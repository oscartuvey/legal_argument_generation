[Facts] these two appeals involve identical questions and  therefore  are disposed of by this common judgment after noticing the factual position  so far as they are relevant. the judgment forms subject matter of challenge in these appeals. the stand taken by the present appellants before the tribunal and the high court was rejected
[Ratio of the decision] no vested right as to tax holding is acquired by a person who is granted concession. sometimes when the courts have intervened on policy grounds the court s view of the range of policies open under the statute or of what is unreasonable policy has not got public acceptance. the courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large  because while considering the applicability of the doctrine  the courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present in the mind of the court

[Facts] these appeals are directed against a judgment and order dated 17 october 2003 passed by the special court constituted under the special courts  trial of offences relating to transactions in securities. in case no such undertakings are filed by the adult members as directed above  within the aforesaid period  the custodian shall stand appointed as receiver of the flats which are described in exh. the learned counsel for the appellants proposes to offer his comments on the bids and the two orders of the special court
[Ratio of the decision] it was enacted for dealing with an extra ordinary situation in the sense that any person who was involved in any offence relating to transaction of any security may be notified whereupon  all his properties stand attached. as the said question has not been gone into by the learned judge  special court  it is necessary that the same be considered and appropriately dealt with. in any view of the matter  the learned judge  special court having not dealt with the question as regard the mode and manner of disbursements of the amount so far as the tax liabilities of the appellants are concerned elaborately  the same requires fresh determination in the light of the decision of this court in harshad shantilal mehta

[Facts] this appeal by special leave is from the judgment and order of the high court of andhra pradesh dated 15th april 1986. chitale learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the high court should be directed to consider the issues relating to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator appointed and functioning under the requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property act 195 i to decide whether a person is protected tenant of an agricultural land or not in the light of ss 99 and 102 of the andhra pradesh  telangana area. the high court discussed 18 documents out of which two are challans and other depositions
[Ratio of the decision] it is relevant at this stage to refer to certain provisions of the central act to consider the controversy involved in this appeal the central act was enacted giving power for requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property for union purposes. no document was filed to show that abdul khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant. that in any event what was the interest of abdul khader had to be determined in determining the question of payment of compensation to him and in so determining the facts and circumstances and the proceedings before the revenue authorities and entries and subsequent deletions had to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator

[Facts] these three appeals by special leave are directed against one and the same judgment dated 25 09 l992 of the division bench of calcutta high court. prior to the passing of the aforesaid order on april 18 1979 while granting special leave petition on 10 11 1978 this court had directed that the state of west bengal will be made a party to the proceeding and further the collector parganas was appointed as receiver in respect of the fisheries owned by the sarkar family. the aforesaid corporation issued an advertisement for auctioning the nalban fishery for a boating complex
[Ratio of the decision] the calcutta high court both the learned single judge as well as the division bench committed serious error of law in directing the receiver to take possession of nalban fishery from the state of west bengal and deliver the vacant possession of the same to the members of the sarkar family. the subsequent incumbent to the post of district magistrate 24 parganas who became the receiver by virtue of his official position had no further jurisdiction to re deliver possession of the nalban fishery to the state of west bengal and the comments already made by the high court on the report of the subsequent receiver sufficiently indicate how he had acted with the bias mind and consequently the nalban fishery having not vested in the state of west bengal under the acquisition act the decree passed by the supreme court on 18 4 1979 remains operative. the aforesaid order cannot be held to operate as res judicata taking away the rights of the state of west

[Facts] karanth   a jnanapeeth awardee who was a novelist play writer essayist encyclopediationist cultural anthropologist artist writer of science environmentalist. i have also placed on record her invaluable services to me in my memoirs  hunchu mansina hathu mukhagalu  1991 edition. by reason of a judgment and decree dated 14 11 2003 the district judge udupi decreed the said suit declaring the plaintiff  respondent as a person having the exclusive copyright in respect of seven prasangas and that she had acquired the same by reason of a will as a residuary legatee and the defendants  appellants or their employees or agents were restrained from performing the said seven ballets or prasangas or any parts thereof in any manner as evolved distinctively by dr
[Ratio of the decision] before adverting to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties we may notice the issues framed in the suit which are    i  does plaintiff prove that late dr. it was also not a case where respondent in any manner whatsoever waived her right. yet again if such performance is conducted before a non paying audience by the appellant which is an institution if it comes within the purview of amateur club or society the same would not constitute any violation of the said order of injunction

[Facts] the appellant claimed to be the tenant in respect of the two premises which are quite adjacent to each other one of which is involved in this appeal. the respondent plaintiff had alleged in both the suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased to him for conducting his business in the name of ahmedabad fine. in any event all these factors were considered by the court of small causes bearing in mind the correct legal principles
[Ratio of the decision] whether the appellant herein and his father had sublet the premises in question in or about 1960 in terms of section 13 1  e  of the bombay rents hotel and lodging house rates control act 1947. for the purpose of the suit no 553 of 1969 with which the appeal is concerned it is relevant to state that the appellant had raised the contention that ahmedabad fine   weaving works was not the tenant of the suit premies but the suit premises was tenanted by the father of the appellant girdharlal chimalal in 1938 and he was the original tenant of the premises and appellant subsequently joined the business of his father as a partner and the name of the partnership firm was ahmedabad fine weaving works. in the eye of law such a clause is really non sequitur or neutral proving neither the existence nor non existence of a genuine firm

[Facts] this appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 03 10 2007 passed by the high court of judicature andhra pradesh at hyderabad in criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 whereby the high court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment dated 19 03 2001 passed by the special judge c b i cases visakhapatnam in c c no 2 of 1998. thereafter pw 1 made a representation to his senior officer requesting him for posting at vijayawada cheerala vetapalam or tenali. 13 11 1997 when he met the appellant accused he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the a p o for signature and asked him to come on the next day i e  on 14 11 1997 and demanded rs 200  for releasing the said office order
[Ratio of the decision] it is clear that the bench itself has clarified that they are not laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to a particular aspect  in the case on hand   quantum of sentence   the parties are entitled to urge all points and re open the case as if they are free to do the same without any restriction. inasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28 01 2008 by this court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in yomeshbhai 2011 indlaw sc 370  supra  we feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points consequently we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant. in other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed it is open to the court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision

[Facts] the accused appellant has been held guily of of fences punishable under section 302 and section 376 2  f  of indian penal code. the accused was arrested on 3 4 1991 on suspicion. the pieces of circumstantial evidence which have been found proved and held as forging an incriminating chain against the accused are as under     i  last seen together   ii  abnormal conduct of the accused   iii  recovery of underwear and baniyan  which was found to be stained with semen and blood group  b  which is also the blood group of the deceased    iv  false plea of alibi  and  v  accused absconding since the date of offence
[Ratio of the decision] we would proceed to examine each of the pieces of incriminating circumstantial evidence so as to find out if each one of the circumstantial evidence is proved individually and whether collectively it forges such a chain of incriminating circumstances as would fasten the guilt on the accused beyond by shadow of reasonable doubt. he was further asked to name the witness in whose statement shalu s reference was available but the investigation officer drew a blank and could not tell the name of the witness from whom any clue as to shalu was received by him. without going into the question as to whether the statement of kalu ram  pw5 is to be believed or not in view of the same having not been supported by santosh pw9  let us assess the intrinsic value of such testimony as a piece of incriminating evidence

[Facts] this appeal is preferred against the judgment dated 19 8 2011 passed by the high court of punjab and haryana in criminal appeal no 181 sb of 2000  whereby the high court partly allowed the appeal filed by the appellants thereby confirming the conviction of the appellants with certain modifications. rakesh  a 4  adopted the stand of his father jage ram. dr  pardeep kumar pw 2  who examined sukhbir found during his medico legal examination a lacerated wound in the middle of the top of the skull
[Ratio of the decision] we have carefully considered the rival contentions and gone through the impugned judgment and perused the materials on record. the burden is on the prosecution that accused had attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution witness. when the matter came up for hearing on 14 10 2014  learned counsel for the appellants informed the court that he had offered rs 5 00 000   by way of demand draft towards compensation to the injured sukhbir in the presence of the sarpanch of the village which he has refused to receive the same

[Facts] this appeal  by special leave  has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 23 february 2005 of bombay high court  aurangabad bench   by which the appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed and their conviction under section 304 b read with section 34 ipc and sentence of 7 years ri imposed thereunder by the learned sessions judge  aurangabad  was affirmed. initially  bhimabai was treated well for about six months  but thereafter the appellants started ill treating her. in his cross  examination he has admitted that when he had gone to village palshi to talk with the appellants regarding the ill treatment being meted out to bhimabai  there was no talk regarding monetary giving and taking
[Ratio of the decision] p c. the main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money and also harassment and beating to bhimabai are her father and mother  viz. 1 000 1 200 for expenses and for manure as he had no sufficient money. as already stated  the appellants were also charged under sections 498 a and 306 read with section 34 ipc but were acquitted of the said charges by the learned sessions judge  which order has attained finality for the reason that the state did not prefer appeal against the same

[Facts] this appeal by special leave arises out of a judgment and order dated 1st march 2005. it appears that the respondent wrote various letters to the appellant for upward revision of the rate in respect of these two vessels but seemingly their request was ultimately turned down on 2nd november 2000 on receipt of which the respondent slammed a legal notice dated 6th november 2000 on the appellant inter alia requesting them to revise the rates on the basis of mutual discussions and settle the accounts. it seems that pursuant to the said notice and some subsequent correspondence exchanged between the parties an arbitral tribunal was constituted
[Ratio of the decision] issue no 1  whether the hon ble arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the dispute between the claimant and the respondent for the period september 1998 to august 1999. before we proceed to examine the rival stands we may note at the outset that neither the arbitral tribunal nor the high court have gone into the question whether the claim made by the respondent would otherwise fall within the ambit of the arbitration clause in the charter party or not. as noted above after the extended period of charter party dated 6th may 1997 had come to an end on 31st august 1998

[Facts] for the sake of convenience we refer to the facts mentioned in civil appeal no of 2008  arising out of s l p  c  no 15729 of 2008  filed by j mitra   co. pvt ltd. thus proceedings commenced before the controller of patents in the year 2000 when the appellant herein sought a patent of their device which was opposed by respondent no 3 in the year 2000 by then the patents  amendment  act 1999 had amended the patents act 1970 w e f 26 3 99 s 25 of the patents act 1970 as amended by patents  amendment  act 1999 dealt with opposition to a patent vides s 25 at that time appeals against decisions made by the controller pertaining to  pre grant oppositions  under s 25 were maintainable before the high court u s 116 2  of the indian patents act 1970. in 2002 the legislature desired an amendment to the law and intended to create an appellate forum to hear appeals against orders passed by the controller consequently patents  amendment
[Ratio of the decision] in short by the patents  amendment  act 2005 for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the patent law between  opposition to the pre grant  and  opposition to the post grant of patent  this was the major structural change in the patent law. the legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the appellate board but by not bringing s 61 into force till 2 4 07 appeals filed during the interregnum as in this case became vulnerable and liable to be dismissed as misconceived as is contended by the appellant. by reason of patents  amendment  act 2005 the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 act is different from what existed earlier

[Facts] an fir was registered on 23 3 1996 on the statement of one prakashi devi. she stated that on the night of 22 23 3 1996 while. the investigating officer was examined as pw 3 the accused examined a witness ex sarpanch of the village as dw 1 and he stated that there was a quarrel between the accused and complainant s son surinder about a water course and subsequently he came to know that the quarrel was converted into a false case against the accused by registering a false allegation that the accused had outraged the modesty of a woman
[Ratio of the decision] the following question therefore arises for our consideration  when the charge is that the accused assaulted  x  and outraged her modesty but the evidence is that he assaulted  y  to outrage her modesty can the accused be punished for having assaulting and outraging the modesty of  y  even though he was not charged with any offence with reference to  y  on the ground that the error or omission in the charge did not prejudice the accused or result in failure of justice. he did not try to challenge the evidence let in to show that he had tried to outrage the modesty of sheela devi as he was not charged with such an offence. when the charge was that the accused attempted to commit trespass into the house of prakashi devi with intent to outrage the modesty of prakashi devi the conclusion of the appellate court and the high court that there was no failure of justice if he is punished for the offence of having assaulted sheela devi and outraging her modesty is opposed to principles of fair play and natural justice embodied in sections 211 212 215 and 464 of the code

[Facts] municipal corporation of delhi aggrieved against the judgment and final order dated 26 03 2004 passed by the high court delhi in criminal revision petition no 185 of 2004 by which order the high court gave the benefit of probation under section 4 of the probation of offenders act 1958. herein after referred to as  pob act   to the second respondent gurcharan singh but maintained the conviction preferred the above appeal. aggrieved by that order the second respondent accused filed an appeal before the sessions court delhi
[Ratio of the decision] we have perused the entire pleadings orders and judgments passed by the lower courts and also of the high court the other annexures in particular annexures p 1 and p 2 and records annexed to this appeal and also heard the arguments of mr. thus the contesting respondent has come to the high court with unclean hands and withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side. since the high court has disposed of the criminal revision without giving an opportunity of filing counter affidavit to the counsel for the mcd and that the respondent did not disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the high court that he has also been convicted in another criminal case no 202 of 1997 the judgment impugned in this appeal cannot be allowed to stand

[Facts] this appeal with special leave is directed against the judgment and order of the labour appellate tribunal of india in a dispute regarding the workers  claim for bonus. on the 4th may  1950  the secretary of the respondent union petitioned to the provincial conciliation officer  textile  that there was more production in 1949 than in 1948  that there was no reason to hold that the profit in 1949 was less than in the previous year and that the rate of bonus was wrongly reduced and asked that bonus for 1949 should also be paid at the rate of annas 4 per rupee. it is significant to observe that this principle was accepted by the labour appellate tribunal itself
[Ratio of the decision] the question which therefore arises for our consideration is mainly whether the workers are entitled to the payment of a bonus in spite of the employer having worked at a loss during the year and incidentally whether the workers have any right  title or interest in the reserves and the undistributed profits of the previous years. if the industrial concern has resulted in a trading loss  there would be no profits of the particular year available for distribution of dividends  much less could the employees claim the distribution of bonus during that year. the shareholders only would be entitled to such benefit and the mere fact that dividends were declared and paid to the shareholders out of such reserves and undistributed profits would not entitle the workers to demand bonus when in fact the working of the industrial concern during the particular year had showed a loss

[Facts] a suit was filed in s c suit no 493 of 1986 in the bombay city civil court bombay by vicco laboratories appellant herein manufacturers of ayurvedic pharmaceutical products against defendant nos 1 to 4 respondents herein for a declaration that the title and format of the suit serial  yeh jo hai zindagi  exclusively belonged to them and respondents nos 1 to 4 have no right thereto and for permanent injunction restraining the said respondents from making use of the title or episodes belonging to the petitioners or any episodes hereafter made. inasmuch as the respondents could not claim any amount at random details regarding expenditure were included in the bills and therefore it is the sponsor s price for sponsoring the suit serial. in doing so the high court noticed that the admitted position in the pleadings and the oral evidence is that the petitioners agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes whereas the respondents had agreed to produce 52 episodes and had made firm commitment to doordarshan to that effect and this circumstance militates against the respondents having undertaken the production at the behest or at the request of the petitioners
[Ratio of the decision] it was therefore found that there was no copy right attached to any idea but copy right is attached to the work and what is important is that not only the idea of producing the suit serial on tv came to the mind of respondent no 2 but he had already started working on it in advance and forwarded it to doordarshan for its approval. it is clear from the findings recorded by the trial court and the appellate court   1 that the respondents have not undertaken the production of the said serial at the instance of the petitioners. 8 that there was no transfer of rights in favour of the petitioners by the respondents in the aforesaid letters and no consideration whatsoever was paid to the respondents for issuing the said letters which have no legal consequences and it was after the petitioners received the letter dated 19 october 1985 from esquire distributing   servicing pvt

[Ratio of the decision] in de smith woolf and jowells judicial review of administrative action 5th edn  it is noticed that not all the activities of the private bodies are subject to private law e g  the activities by private bodies may be governed by the standards of public law when its decisions are subject to duties conferred by statute or when by virtue of the function it is performing or possibly its dominant position in the market it is under an implied duty to act in the public interest. after detailed discussion the learned authors have summarized the position with the following propositions   1  the test of whether a body is performing a public function and is hence amenable to judicial review may not depend upon the source of its power or whether the body is ostensibly a public or a private body. however not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject matter of judicial review

[Facts] twelve accused persons were tried for offences under section 302 307 149 324 147 148 and section 3 of terrorist and disruptive activites. some of the prosecution witnesses including the deceased pw9 and pw14 were already standing near the jagdamba hotel. the evidence of pw10 pw 11 and pw 12 has received ample corroboration from the testimony of pw 9 pw 13 pw 14 and pw 15 who deposed that while the witnesses were narrating the incident of the video parlour to waman band patte pw 15 and other witnesses present there the accused party arrived in a jeep and two auto rickshaws variously armed and opened an attack on the complainant party with a view to teach them a lesson for the altercation which had taken place earlier at the video parlour
[Ratio of the decision] through this appeal under section 19 of tada the appellants have called in question their conviction and sentence. in so far as the remaining appellants are concerned the evidence of the eye witnesses and particularly of pw 3 and pws 9 to 14 unmistakably connects them with the assault on the complainant party near the jagdamba hotel and at the math resulting in the death of popat and injuries being caused to pw9 and pw14 despite searching cross examination nothing has been brought out in their cross examination from which any doubt may arise about the participation of a 1 a 5 a 8 a 9 and a 11 in the assault or discredit the testimony of any of these witnesses. from our independent examination of the material on the record we are satisfied that the prosecution has been able to establish its case against a 5 a 8 a 9 and a 11 and the deceased a 1 beyond a reasonable doubt

[Facts] this is an appeal on a certificate u art. on the 19th july  1948  the family idol of dwarka nath  sree sree iswar sridhar jew  by its next friend debabrata ghosh  the son of nagendra  filed the suit  out of which the present appeal arises  against the appellants as  also against susilabala and the two sons of jogendra by her  amongst others  for a declaration that the premises nos. the appellants filed on the 18th august  1950  an appeal against this judgment being appeal no  118 of 1950
[Ratio of the decision] the appeal is concerned only with the premises. 3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises. if nagendra was thus a sevayat of the idol it could not be urged that his possession could in any manner whatever be adverse to the idol and his dealings with the said premises in the manner he purported to do after the 12th october  1920  could not be evidence of any adverse possession against the idol

[Facts] interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b  of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  hereinafter called and referred to for the sake of brevity as  the said act   is involved herein. allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963. singh has filed a reply in this petition bringing out that presently he is the registered owner of the trademark which is sought to be cancelled in this petition
[Ratio of the decision] correctness or otherwise of the said order has not been questioned. when the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s  3  of s 46. for the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties

[Ratio of the decision] we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march 2011 though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february 1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue. but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled

[Facts] these appeals are preferred by four accused against the common judgment of the high court of chhattisgarh at bilaspur confirming the judgment of the additional sessions judge bemetara district durg convicting the appellants u s 302 read with ss 34 and 120b of the indian penal code  hereinafter referred to as  ipc   and sentencing each of them to undergo imprisonment for life with a fine of rs 1 000   and in default to undergo additional rigorous imprisonment for three months. he deposed in court that on 25 11 2003 when he returned home he found servant anil kumar  pw 21  was weeping. m deodhar who gave their report which is marked as exhibit p 18 spot map was prepared by the inquiry officer  io   bloodstained cloth of accused shashi tripathi was taken into possession along with broken bangles  bloodstained cement mortar and plain cement mortar were also taken into possession
[Ratio of the decision] we have carefully examined the manner in which the identification parade was conducted and the manner in which the boy  anil kumar  pw 21  identified the accused in court and we have no reason to doubt the identification of the accused which assumes importance in this case since the boy did not know the accused before the incident. pw 21  his statement that the accused chandra prakash attacked the deceased is corroborated by the recovery of knife from chandra prakash. the observations of this court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them

[Facts] the price which the manufacturer of barlagan kotone  reported to the central government in 1971 was rs 24 735 68 per kg. the manufacturer applied for fixation of price at rs 8 500 per kg. these notifications were questioned on several grounds by the manufacturers and they have been quashed by the delhi high court on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice
[Ratio of the decision] it was just the other day that our brothers ranganath misra and m m  dutt  jj  had to give directions in a case  vincent panikurbangara v  union of india  where a public spirited litigant had complained about the unscrupulous exploitation of the indian drug and pharmaceutical market by multinational corporations by putting in circulation low quality and even deleterious drugs. for example  if the legislature has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determination of the price  we will  if necessary  enquire into the question whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price. no doubt the order as made on november 25  1981 has the manufacturers on terms  but the consumer public has been left high and dry

[Facts] challenge in this appeal is to the order of a division bench of madras high court allowing the appeal filed by the respondent  hereinafter referred to as the  accused   the accused was convicted for offence punishable under section 302 of the indian penal code 1860  in short the  ipc   and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of rs 10 000  with default stipulation by principal district judge madurai. initially p w 40 suspected the role of p w 1 his wife p w 2 p w 3 from whose house certain incriminating material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as p w 4 who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of p w 1 subsequently however p w 42 who took over investigation from p w 40 filed charge sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that p ws 1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime. learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the judgment of the high court
[Ratio of the decision] there is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this court as far back as in 1952. apart from the fact that there is niggling doubt about the so called confession in view of statement under section 164 of the code of p w 22 and the statement of c w 1 a further doubt is raised regarding such aspect in view of evidence of c w 1 to the effect that he had seen such computer in the room of the deceased when they had gone to the room after the offence was reported. in this context it is to be noted that c w 1 states that  m  dollar was taken from him by p w 42 for the purpose of facilitating investigation

[Facts] these appeals have been preferred from the judgment and order of the high court dated 25 11 2009 in writ petitions  civil  no 46457 2009. thereafter the state government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of chief secretary government of u p vide office memorandum dated 12 9 2007 to evaluate and consider the shifting of prisons identified to be shifted in the first phase. thus the state government issued notifications u ss 4 1  and 17 on 21 08 2008
[Ratio of the decision] before this court the appellants broadly raised the following arguments  1 whether or not the state government was justified in acquiring the said pieces of fertile agricultural land when there were alternative sites of unfertile banjar land available. if public purpose can be satisfied by not rendering common man homeless and by exploring other avenues of acquisition the courts before sanctioning an acquisition must in exercise of its power of judicial review focus its attention on the concept of social and economic justice. this slow pace at which the government machinery had functioned in processing the acquisition clearly evinces that there was no urgency for acquiring the land so as to warrant invoking s 17  4  of the act

[Facts] by order dated october 7 1993 passed by the constitution bench three questions were referred for consideration by a larger bench. the authorities to which the statements are submitted shall verify the correctness of the statements and if they find any irregularity they shall call upon the college concerned to rectify the same. by order dated october 7 19933 the constitution bench having regard to the fact that the year 1993 being a year of transition and adjustment and also in view of the orders of the government of india permitting admission of foreign students to the extent of as much as 50  of the seats as well as the time that had already elapsed permitted the private professional colleges to admit non resident indians and foreign students up to a maximum extent of 15  of the intake capacity of that year

[Ratio of the decision] having regard to the order that we intend to make we are not persuaded to accept the objection raised on behalf of the first respondent that present appeal preferred directly before this court from the impugned order passed by the ipab is not maintainable and must be dismissed as such. the moot question which has been debated before us is whether or not the first respondent is an aggrieved person. section 46 1  of the 1958 act enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use as stated in clause  a  and or clause  b  to be an aggrieved person under section 46 he must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way  it must not be a fanciful suggestion of grievance

[Ratio of the decision] first and the foremost we must consider what is the evidence led by the prosecution to bring home the guilt of accused. once the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic ingredients of section 304 b the court will presume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives complained of has caused her death. the high court acquitted pathan khadar basha the fatherin law of the deceased as there was no direct evidence against him

[Ratio of the decision] the only question that falls for consideration is as to whether a second revision under section 257 is maintainable and that whether the state government exceeds its jurisdiction in entertaining the second revision. it is therefore clear that in revenue matters the state government is the supreme revenue authority. in other words the state government in exercise of its revisional as well as general power of superintendence and control can call for any record of proceedings and consider the legality and propriety of the orders passed by the revenue officers under section 247 or 257 of the code

[Facts] the present appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 01 07 2002 passed by the high court of bombay at goa in criminal appeal no  6 of 2000 convicting the accused appellant u s. 302 of the indian penal code  for short the  the ipc   and sentencing him to undergo life imprisonment for the offence by setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial court. thereafter  according to pw 1  accused no  3 handed back the knife to the appellant and accused no  2 brought the oil lamp which was hung in the room and hit the oil lamp on the head of rauji  the deceased. on the basis of complaint made by pw 1  an fir was registered and the accused came to be arrested
[Ratio of the decision] facts giving rise to the present appeal may be stated first so as to enable us to appreciate the arguments raised by the parties more effectively. the place of occurrence was in total darkness and even the persons belonging to the complainant side were not available  therefore  bringing them to the police station where there was sufficient light and recording the complaint at 3 00 a m  cannot  in any manner  cast any doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case. besides  all the aforesaid eye witnesses were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital

[Facts] the respondent joined service as technical assistant with the gujarat state electricity board  hereinafter refined to as the board  he was promoted to the post of deputy engineer. the chief engineer discharged the respondent from service as he had continued to remain absent from duty w e f. march 30 1974 to may 27 1974. on march 29 1974 the superintending engineer of the board issued the order transferring the respondent from surat to ukai on 30 3 1974 the respondent was relieved from surat and directed to join his duty at ukai but the respondent did not join his duty at the new place of posting
[Ratio of the decision] this appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the high court of gujarat dated 28 2 1986 allowing the respondent s writ petition and quashing order of discharge from service and directing his reinstatement in service. perusal of the averments made in paragraphs 17 18 23 and 25  2  ii  of the counter affidavit filed in reply to the petitioner s writ petition before the learned single judge shows that the board had categorically pleaded that the respondent was informed by letter dated 24 4 1974 that his representation to postpone his transfer was rejected and he should obey the order of transfer. no new plea had been raised by the board before the division bench instead the plea relating to service of the aforesaid letter had already been before the learned single judge

[Ratio of the decision] this appeal is by special leave against the judgment of the high court of punjab and haryana confirming the conviction of the accused under section 5 1  c  of the prevention of corruption act 1947 as also the sentence awarded by the sessions judge of one year s rigorous imprisonment and a fine of rs. at the most it shows that a small portion of the crops were cut but it is apparent that that has not been taken into account by the collector in assessing the value of the crop because it is on that day that crops were inspected for that purpose and subsequently the agricultural officer also had in his letter dated 18 2 63  which has been cited in the award ex. he also inform in that letter that the excavation in all available portions of the taxi track and runway has been completed

[Facts] act liii of 1961   hereinafter referred to as  the act   which in view of s 2 1  of the act is the law applicable even to women workers employed in plantations. while calculating the aforesaid amount of maternity benefit the establishment admittedly excluded twelve sundays being wageless holidays which fell during the period of the respondent s actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and the six weeks immediately following that day. the single judge of the high court to whom the case was assigned allowed the petition holding that twelve weeks for which maternity benefit is provided for in subs  3  of s 5 of the act must be taken to mean twelve weeks of work and the computation of the benefit had to be made with reference to the actual days on which the woman would have worked but for her inability
[Ratio of the decision] cochin v. for a proper determination of the question involved in the appeal it would we think be useful to refer to certain provisions of the act which have a bearing on the subject matter of the controversy before us. the real though difficult question that calls for determination by us is as to what is the connotation of the term  week  occurring in sub ss  1  and  3  of s 5 of the act and whether the computation of the maternity benefit prescribed by the act for the a foresaid two periods has to be made taking a  week  as signifying a cycle of seven days including a sunday or a cycle of seven days minus a sunday which is said to be a wageless day as the act does not contain any definition of the word  week  it has to be understood in its ordinary dictionary sense. third edi tion  volume 37 at p 84 is strictly the time between midnight on saturday and the same hour on the next succeeding saturday but the term is also applied to any period of seven successive days

[Facts] these appeals arising out of a judgment and order dated 26 4 2000 passed in writ petition no 1188 of 1997 by the high court of madhya pradesh  indore bench  involving similar questions of law and fact were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment. there is no difference in their work and the work of the employees of indore development authority. aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said award  the respondent  authority herein filed a writ petition before the madhya pradesh high court  indore bench  which was marked as writ petition no 1188 of 1997
[Ratio of the decision] a dispute arose as to whether all the appellants were employed for the purpose of the said project or the appellants in civil appeal no 337 of 2002 were appointed in the year 1991 by the authority for its own job. had the appointments of the appellants been made in terms of the provisions of the adhiniyam and rules framed thereunder  the respondent authority was statutorily enjoined to make an offer of appointment in writing which was to be accepted by the appellants herein. the appellants have not produced any such ticket

[Facts] ujjagar singh  the appellant herein  a resident of village bangawali  tehsil malerkotla  was tried and convicted by the additional sessions judge  sangrur for the murder of his niece mukhtiar kaur and was awarded the death penalty. puran singh had however transferred 30 or 35 bighas of agricultural land falling to his share after the death of his father in the name of the appellant s sons by a collusive decree in the year 1994 and the suggestion was that this transaction had been objected to by mukhtiar kaur who was demanding that the land be returned to her. on the completion of the investigation  a charge sheet under sections 302  376 and 309 of the ipc was filed against the accused and as he pleaded not guilty he was brought to trial
[Ratio of the decision] we have heard the learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record. the motive is in the mind of the accused and can seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy. it is therefore apparent that the weapon had indeed been fired by the appellant from a close range and that the blackened portion around the wound had been removed by dr  sanjay uppal

[Facts] the appellants in this appeal claiming to be the tenants of agricultural land bearing survey no 125 1 measuring 3 acres 11 gunthas. when the matter stood thus the father of the respondent nos 3 and 4 gondappa who is the uncle of the 5th respondent rajashankar filed form no 7 before the land tribunal claiming occupancy rights in respect of the land in dispute contending that he is the tenant of the said land under the 5th respondent from the year 1968 i e subsequent to the date of mortgage. to prove this fact he relied upon the entries in the r t c extract for the years 1968 to 1974 wherein his name is shown as the person in cultivation of the land in dispute
[Ratio of the decision] in our view although the high court had set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the tribunals below under the karnataka land reforms. such being the findings arrived at by the high court with which we are in concurrence it is difficult to hold that the tenancy claimed by the appellants in respect of the scheduled land could be established. considering the above aspect of the matter and after considering the scope of section 121a of the act we are therefore unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under section 121a of the act the high court was not entitled to set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the appellate authority and the land tribunal

[Facts] plot nos 17 7 and 17 8 were owned by respondent no 4 herein. in spite of this you have not handed over the possession. the validity and  or legality of the said notice was questioned by the appellant by filing a writ petition in the high court of gujarat inter alia contending that the purported final allotment of plot no 165 in favour of the respondent no 3 and allotment of final plot no 157 in favour of the respondent no 4 were made without issuing any notice as envisaged u ss 52 and 53 of the act
[Ratio of the decision] interpretation and  or application of the provisions of the gujarat town planning and urban development act 1976  for short  the act   and the rules framed thereunder known as the gujarat town planning and urban development rules 1979. whether irrespective of rule 26 of the rules which prescribes for issuance of a general public notice any special notice upon the appellant was required to be served by the state or by the authority in our opinion cannot be gone into by us in these proceedings for the first time. issuance of any such direction in our opinion is legally impermissible

[Facts] according to the respondent by these grants  parvanas  read together he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the said villages that is to say it was a proprietary jagir that was granted to him by the then ruler. it appears that for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the act the competent authority  collector of district sabarkantha  held an inquiry into the question whether the respondent s jigir was proprietary  involving any right or interest in the soil  or non proprietary  involving mere assignment of land revenue or rent due to government  under s 2  4   i  of the act and having regard to the documentary and other evidence led before it the competent authority by its order dated september 8 1959 held that the daljitgarh jagir of the respondent was a proprietary jagir. the appellants seek to challenge the said judgment and order of the gujarat high court in this appeal
[Ratio of the decision] the main question raised in this appeal by special leave at the instance of state of gujarat and the collector of sabarkantha against the gujarat high court s judgment and order dated january 30 31 1975 allowing the writ petition of the respondent is whether once the competent authority under s 2 4   i  of the bombay merged territories and areas  jagirs abolition. the general question is whether once the competent authority under s 2  4   i  of the act declares that the particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s 37 2  of the land revenue code with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent. we find considerable force in this contention

[Facts] appellant before us was detained u s 3 of the conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities. so far as the question of non placement of material documents before the detaining authority is concerned we may notice the following dates   i. by a letter dated 5 7 2002 the authorities of dri stated that appellant stood exonerated for earlier years after detailed examination. by an order dated 18 11 2004 the civil court issued contempt notice to the authorities of dri for non release of documents and the authorities of dri made a statement before the court that the documents are being returned
[Ratio of the decision] before us several other grounds viz  non placement of vital  material documents before the detaining authority non supply of documents relied on or referred to in the order of detention as also non application of mind on the part of the detaining authority had been raised. furthermore as noticed hereinbefore the authorities of the dri by a letter dated 28 02 2005 requested the bank to defreeze the bank accounts of appellant. we have been taken through the order of detention

[Facts] challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a division bench of the madhya pradesh high court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellant on the ground that it was not maintainable. hereinafter referred to as the  act   it was held that the order was passed in exercise of power of superintendence u art 227 of the constitution of india 1950  in short the  constitution   against which the letters patent appeal is not maintainable. since the impugned order is passed by a learned single judge
[Ratio of the decision] that being so the mere fact that the writ petition was styled u art 227 of the constitution is of no consequence. this conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned single judge in his judgment as seen earlier. consequently it could not be said that cl 15 of the letters patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned single judge

[Facts] the appellant is a trust which wanted to establish a self financing engineering college and submitted an application during 1994 95 to the university of kerala as well as to all india council for technical education  hereinafter called the  aicte. the government was also directed to reconsider its decision. but the state in its counter filed in the high court tried to explain that the director of technical education had opined that during the year 1995 96 it might not be practicable to start the college for the director could not ascertain the details of the facilities available
[Ratio of the decision] the following points arise for consideration    1. the reference to the commission in the above cl 9 7  is to the commission of inspection appointed by the university. obtaining the  views  of the state government as already stated did not amount to obtaining its  approval  procedure and conditions for affiliation could not be inconsistent with the provisions of the central act in particular s 10 k  of the regulation and the university could not seek approval of government

[Facts] this civil appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and decree dated 29th november 1977 rendered by a single judge of the gujarat high court in second appeal no 348 of 1973 which arose out of regular civil suit no 921 of 1966 filed in the court of joint civil judge baroda  civil court  by the appellant herein as plaintiff against respondents 1 and 2 herein. the issue relating to their claim that they were tenants of the said properties  the agricultural lands as urged therein had to be referred by the civil court to the mamlatdar under section 85 a of the bombay tenancy and agricultural lands act 1948   the bt   al act  for recording his finding thereon and the suit had to be stayed pending receipt of the finding thereon so that the suit may be finally disposed of on the basis of such finding. court it also made a preliminary decree in favour of the plaintiff for redemption of the suit properties
[Ratio of the decision] no controversy is raised in this appeal as regards the findings of the civil court that the deeds of mortgage executed by the plaintiff in respect of the suit properties were mortgages by conditional sale. in the present case as has already been pointed out by us the plaintiff appellant did not claim that the defendants or any of them were in possession of the suit properties as tenants and there was a surrender by them of the possession either expressly or impliedly as would make the court to come to the conclusion that the possession of the suit properties with the defendants was surrendered by them pursuant to the mortgage by conditional sale executed in their favour. in the case of a lease the estate that is in the lessor is a reversion

[Facts] the state of manipur is in appeal before us questioning the judgment and order dated 29 07 2005 passed by a division bench of the guwahati high court in wa nos 61 78 79 95 and 100 of 1999 upholding a judgment and order of a learned single judge of the said court dated 19 02 1999 in c r nos 324 1012 568 1022 and 1023 of 1998. dated 6th january 1998 regarding the alleged appointment of ad hoc  regular appointment to the post of lambus  mandols. in view of the aforementioned stand taken by the said shri tayeng the offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents were cancelled by an order dated 17 02 1998 a corrigendum thereto was however issued on 21 02 1998 stating   no 2 15 93 com rev
[Ratio of the decision] the respondents herein filed writ petitions before the high court on 4 06 1998 questioning the said order of cancellation of their appointments. we would proceed on the assumption that the state had not framed any recruitment rules in terms of the proviso appended to art 309 of the constitution of india but the same by itself would not clothe the commissioner of revenue to make recruitments in violation of the provisions contained in arts 14 and 16 of the constitution of india. we as noticed hereinbefore do not know as to under what circumstances the orders of appointments were issued

[Facts] we have heard learned counsel on both sides. the admitted facts are that the respondents through their agents had registered trade mark  raleigh  and other trade marks  12 marks  under the indian merchandise marks act 1889  4 of 1989  and the trade marks act 1940  5 of 1940  the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  43 of 1958   for short the  act  which came into force with effect from october 3 1958 has repealed the predecessor act and now the act is in operation. on march 24 1982 the appellant made an application under sections 32 46 and 56 of the act against the respondents in the high court of calcutta in suit no 266 92 pleading inter alia that the respondents had failed to provide technical assistance by passing the technical know how to sen raleigh after november 1 1976 neither the appellant nor sen raleigh were registered users of the trade mark after november 1 1976
[Ratio of the decision] in view of the diverse contentions the question arises  whether the high court was right in refusing to rectify and strike off the trade marks of the respondents from the register of trade marks. the benefit of s 46 would be available during the period for which the agreement registered and user continued in furtherance thereof. though the appellant has not used the trade mark by itself since 1954 and after the expiry of the permitted use by sen raleigh until the notice was issued by the respondent directing the appellant not to use the trade mark the appellant came to use the same in passing off bicycles manufactured by it under trade mark of the respondent

[Facts] one lakshminarayana iyer  a hindu brahmin  who owned considerable properties in the tirunelveli district  died on 13th december  1924  leaving him surviving a widow ranganayaki  and a married daughter ramalakshmi. on the 18th september  1945  the suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the plaintiff  the husband and the sole heir of ramalakshmi  for a declaration that the said sale would not be binding on him beyond the lifetime of the widow. during the pendency of the appeal the widow died on 14th february  1948
[Ratio of the decision] before his death he executed a will on 16th november  1924  the construction of which is in controversy in this appeal. in our opinion  even if that suggestion is accepted that for the limited purposes mentioned in the will the widow could alienate  this power would fall far short of the powers that a hindu widow enjoys under hindu law. under that law she has the power to alienate the estate for the benefit of the soul of the husband  for pilgrimage and for the benefit of the estate and for other authorized purposes

[Facts] i was tried before the court of sessions  visakhapatnam for offences under s  120 b  indian penal code  s  409  s  477 a. and s  471 read with s  467  i p c. while respondent no  2 was tried for an offence under s  120 b and for offences under ss. on april 30  1952 the respondent no  1  by selling some of his property  himself paid rs  50  000   to the andhra power system towards the sum due to it from vesco and had promised to pay the balance shortly thereafter. the directors of vesco thereafter authorised k  s  dutt  one of the directors to lodge a complaint with the police which he accordingly lodged on may 19  1952
[Ratio of the decision] ganeswara rao was also an old employee of aeco  having been appointed a stenotypist in the year 1923 on an initial salary of rs. the object of the learned additional sessions judge quite clearly was  as already stated  to leave no loophole for a complaint to be made before the appellate court of incomplete or insufficient examination under s  342 finally we are clear that it was not the duty of the court to draw the pointed attention of the respondents to the provisions of sub s. 4  of s  342 and tell them that they may  if they chose  enter the witness box. the complaint of mr  bhimasankaram is that the approver should have been questioned about the various facts which were sought to be established through his evidence and it was only if and when he was in a difficulty that he should have been allowed to refer to the account books

[Facts] this appeal is by special leave against the judgment and decree of the high court of kerala which dismissed an appeal against the judgment and decree of the subordinate court of havelikkara. 112 of 1100   1925 a d. as the suit of the illom had been finally disposed of and the title of  the illom to the lands was not established  the appellant apprehending that he might be ejected in the above l c  case filed a suit. against that order a civil miscellaneous appeal no  206 of 1110 m e   1934 35 a d   was filed in the high court of travancore
[Ratio of the decision] it is the case of the appellant that even  after the act was passed  unauthorised occupants of land belonging to the government who had made improvements therein had  under the rules made both under the act and the land assignment act a preferential claim over others for getting kuthakapattom or assignment of the property in their possession. it was conceded before the trial court and no attempt was made to establish anything to the contrary before the high court that no notice of forfeiture as required under s  9 was given to the appellant. no authority has been cited for this novel proposition  and if accepted  it would give validity to a dangerous principle which will condone all acts of deliberate and wrongful trespass because any person desparate enough to trespass on other mans  land without any claim of title can always plead that he had a bona fide intention of improving the land whether the owner of that land wants that improvement or not

[Facts] three civil appeals  stemming from three revision petitions to the high court of orissa under the orissa estates abolition act  1951  orissa act i of 1952   for short  the act  have reached this court  thanks to special leave granted to the appellant  who is common in all the cases. the said order  the relevant portion of which we are concerned  runs thus    he would immediately call upon the divisional forest officer to make appraisement within three months from the receipt of the record. even so  the total figure was less than what the divisional forest officer had recommended
[Ratio of the decision] this estate vested in the state on april 1  1960 by force of the act and the crucial question agitated before us  consequentially turns on the quantum of compensation awardable under chapter v of the act. the serious question that survives for consideration is covered by the remaining points which more or less overlap. equally clearly  a slight error has crept into the judge s order because he does not make any reference specifically to the statutory requirement of approval of the chief conservator of forests of the appraisement made by the forest officer

[Facts] this appeal by special leave has been preferred by tata consultancy engineers against an award dated 20th december 1978 of the industrial tribunal maharashtra bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits. the annexures from the company to the director general posts   telegraphs delhi  ex c 27  indicates the important projects the company was handling in india and abroad and the amount of foreign exchange earned and repatriated. the tribunal then observed         the flat increase of rs 150  in the category of draftsmen and rs 100  in the case of the other categories would be fair  thereafter various other matters were considered and finally the tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother pathak j the question of  fitment  was then considered in the following manner    fitment   if as on 1st january 1976 an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade
[Ratio of the decision] however this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission. none of the alternatives was actually adopted by the tribunal because when the award was made the tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of rs 150  in the case of the category of draughtsmen and rs 100  in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories. it was open to the tribunal to adopt the position which it did
