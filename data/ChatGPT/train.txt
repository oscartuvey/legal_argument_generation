[Facts] Tata Consultancy Engineers filed an appeal against a 1978 award by the Industrial Tribunal in Maharashtra, which revised wage scales and benefits for certain employee categories. Tata Consultancy Engineers started as a partnership and later became a division of Tata Sons Limited, functioning as a consulting service without manufacturing products. The company's workforce included engineers, supervisors, and various workmen categories. The dispute arose when demands by the Tata Consultancy Employees Union for wage scale revisions were not met. The matter was referred to the tribunal for adjudication. The tribunal recognized the need for revising wage scales due to the company's increased paying capacity over the years. It considered industry financial capacity and wage structures and ultimately decided to revise the wage structure. The tribunal emphasized the financial burden and competition faced by the company and took note of its service-oriented nature. The tribunal computed the company's gross profits, considering factors like taxation, development rebate, and depreciation, and determined the average profits. It revised wage scales, granting flat increases in various categories, but rejected modifying the existing dearness allowance scheme. The revised scales were made retroactive from January 1, 1976. The Tata Consultancy Employees Union appealed against the rejection of their demand to link dearness allowance to the cost of living index. The union argued that the company could bear the additional financial burden, citing evidence from the company's documents. The tribunal asserted that the company could bear the burden and proceeded to modify the wage scales accordingly, addressing fitment and increments based on years of service. In summary, the appeal pertains to Tata Consultancy Engineers contesting a tribunal's decision to revise wage scales and benefits. The tribunal considered the company's financial capacity, existing wage structures, and evidence presented by both parties before making its award.
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving Tata Consultancy Engineers and their employees' union, revolving around wage scale revisions and dearness allowance. There appears to be a clerical error in the original award, which led to a misunderstanding regarding the inclusion of a flat increase in employees' pay. The tribunal's original intention was to revise wage scales, integrate flat increases into those scales, and not provide separate ad hoc increases to individual employees. The employees sought to correct this by filing an application under rule 31 to clarify the award's intent. The court considers whether the correction was within the tribunal's authority and determines that it was, as it rectified an accidental omission. The passage also discusses the argument about dearness allowance, highlighting that while linking it to the cost of living index is common, other methods can also be reasonable if adequately justified. Ultimately, the court dismisses the appeals, upholding the tribunal's decision.

[Facts] The passage discusses two appeals with identical questions regarding the legality of withdrawing benefits as subsidies. The appellants challenge a Madras High Court judgment that upheld the validity of a government order (G.O.MS) discontinuing purchase tax exemption for mills exceeding a certain ceiling. The case involves the principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation. The appellants argue that the High Court erred by not considering their counterarguments, presenting undisclosed materials, and violating natural justice. They also claim that the government's retrospective withdrawal of benefits lacks proper authentication and is impermissible. The High Court's factual findings include that the respondents established their units before the subsidy orders and without inducement. The subsidies were concessions that could be modified in public interest. The core challenge revolves around the accuracy of these factual conclusions. The passage also introduces the concept of promissory estoppel as a rule of equity gaining significance in recent years.
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses the legal principles related to vested rights, legitimate expectations, policy changes, arbitrariness, and executive actions. It emphasizes that concessions don't confer vested rights, and promissory estoppel applies when industry relies on government representation. Legitimate expectations arise from representations or past practice, but are limited by public interest and legal boundaries. Article 14 requires fair and non-arbitrary policy changes, and the concept of arbitrariness is context-dependent. The passage cautions against undue court intervention in policy matters and highlights the importance of reasonableness. It also examines the doctrine of legitimate expectation, emphasizing it's not a key to unlock natural justice and must be within legal limitations. The passage concludes that the High Court's decision wasn't tenable, and that the legality of retrospective withdrawal needs further examination by the court. The state government is directed to provide further affidavits, and the plea of legitimate expectation will be considered based on these materials. The High Court should reconsider the case based on these principles and issues.

[Facts] The appeals are against a judgment from a special court regarding transactions in securities. The appellants are related to Harshad S. Mehta and own flats in Mumbai. The appellants and Harshad Mehta were notified under the Securities Act. The flats were attached, and various applications were filed in the special court. The custodian sought permission to sell certain properties, while the appellants sought the release of their properties. The court allowed some applications, permitting sale upon certain conditions, while other applications were dismissed. The appellants had earlier applied for de-notification, but withdrew them. Disputed statements led to an appeal. The court directed the special court to proceed with the bidding process, subject to the appeal's outcome. Commercial property sale was excluded due to prior orders.
[Ratio of the decision] The case pertains to the application of a law that provides strict measures for dealing with individuals involved in securities-related offenses. The law allows their properties to be attached, and the court must determine its purpose and intent. The right of notified individuals to challenge their liability or property attachment can be raised early on or when liabilities need to be discharged. The court must consider whether the appellants were correctly subject to the law's provisions, whether individual liabilities should have been separately assessed, and whether tax liabilities are valid. The court must decide on selling commercial properties and releasing residential properties from attachment. Both parties have raised various contentions not previously raised in court. The custodian of assets under this law has wide powers. The appellants' properties are attached as notified persons. A key question is whether the appellants' claims can be raised as defense arguments. While limitations bar remedies, not rights, the defense's validity is yet to be determined. The appellants argue their properties should only be attached for liabilities during the statutory period. The court must also address the question of whether the individuals were rightfully considered part of the harshad mehta group and whether their liabilities can be separate. Certain assessments have been set aside, and reassessments are pending. The court must consider if the defense arguments can be raised and whether assets and liabilities should be treated separately. The court also needs to reevaluate the tax liabilities. The commercial properties' sale isn't disputed, but the residential properties' sale requires reexamination. The court needs to reassess various aspects, including attachments, liabilities, tax dues, and property sales, and it must consider subsequent events and related claims. The proceedings must continue expeditiously and not grant unnecessary adjournments. The custodian may bring updated tax assessments to the court's attention. The court should consider all aspects carefully and provide appropriate rulings.

[Facts] Three appeals have been filed against a Kolkata High Court judgment dated 25th September 1992. The appellants are the State of West Bengal, the State Fishery Development Corporation Ltd, and Bansilal Farms. The dispute revolves around Nalban Fishery, involving the Sarkar family in Kolkata. A partition suit was filed in 1955 regarding this fishery. The state requisitioned the fishery in 1969 under the West Bengal Land Requisition and Acquisition Act. The state took possession, and the Sarkar family challenged the requisition in court. Various legal actions were taken, including appeals and a writ petition. Possession was transferred to the state, and later to the State Fisheries Development Corporation. The Sarkar family sought possession again through legal proceedings. Bansilal Farms, which had a license to operate a boating complex on the fishery, also became involved. Appeals were filed challenging a court order that directed the collector to take possession from the state and give it to the Sarkar family.
[Ratio of the decision] The Calcutta High Court, both the learned single judge and the division bench, made a serious legal mistake by ordering the receiver to take possession of Nalban Fishery from the State of West Bengal and deliver it to the Sarkar family members. The subsequent receiver, who took over the role of district magistrate, had no authority to re-deliver possession of Nalban Fishery to the state, and the subsequent receiver's actions showed bias. Nalban Fishery had not vested in the state under the acquisition act, so the Supreme Court's 1979 decree remained valid. The State of West Bengal had not been bound by the earlier compromise decree regarding the fishery. The special leave petition's dismissal affirmed the state's legal requisition of Nalban Fishery since 1969. The central question was whether the partition suit's decree allocated Nalban Fishery to certain Sarkar family members and if this decree would affect the state's rights. Although not a party to the suit, the state was added as a party to protect its interests. The decree did not affect the state's requisitioned rights over Nalban Fishery, as it was requisitioned before the decree. The question of whether the receiver appointed by the court had the authority to take possession of Nalban Fishery was considered. The first receiver's possession was symbolic and was based on the assumption that the fishery's lease had expired. However, the state's requisition of the fishery was valid, and the possession taken by the receiver was erroneous. The succeeding receiver rightfully corrected this mistake and returned possession to the state. The issue of whether a 1980 court order would operate as res judicata was discussed. This order did not affect the state's rights as it wasn't a party to the proceedings. The order merely directed the receiver to carry out the Supreme Court's directions regarding the fishery's demarcation, which didn't affect the state's rights. The impact of the amendment to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act in 1986 was also examined. The amended provisions were not assessed in detail, as a writ petition challenging the amendment's validity was pending. It was acknowledged that the state's rights might be subject to the outcome of the pending writ petition on the constitutionality of the amended act.

[Facts] Yakshagana is a traditional ballet dance form with a unique heritage. Dr. Kota Shivarama Karanth (Dr. Karanth), a Jnanapeeth awardee known for his multifaceted talents, developed a new form of Yakshagana. In 1994, he executed a will in favor of the respondent, Malini Mallya. After Dr. Karanth's passing, a performance of his developed Yakshagana took place in New Delhi in 2001. The respondent filed a suit claiming copyright infringement in relation to the dance, asserting rights from the will. She alleged that Dr. Karanth had developed a distinctive form named "Yaksha Ranga," a creative extension of traditional Yakshagana, and the appellants' performance in New Delhi without her permission violated her copyright. The plaintiff claimed copyright under the will's clauses 11 and 12. The clauses mentioned the respondent's dedicated service to Dr. Karanth, his acknowledgment of her contributions, and the distribution of his copyrights and assets to her after his passing. The respondent sought a declaration of exclusive copyright, injunction, and damages. The appellants, however, disputed the respondent's claim, stating that Dr. Karanth's work was carried out under the auspices of an institute, funded and supported by an organization. The case progressed through the lower courts, with the district judge ultimately granting the plaintiff exclusive copyright over seven prasangas (dance sequences) and restraining the defendants from performing them. The appellants appealed this decision to the Karnataka High Court, which upheld the lower court's ruling. The trial court recognized the respondent's equitable interest and issued a declaratory decree. The central issues revolved around Dr. Karanth's developed Yakshagana form, the respondent's claim to copyright through the will, and the defendants' alleged infringement. The lower courts sided with the respondent, affirming her exclusive copyright and issuing injunctions against the defendants' performances.
[Ratio of the decision] The court discusses the issues raised in the case related to copyright infringement of Yakshagana performances. It notes that while dramatic literature can be considered a form of literary work, the copyright provisions of the act differentiate between "literary work" and "dramatic work." Therefore, performances like dance fall under the definition of "dramatic work" rather than "literary work." However, this distinction doesn't mean that the provisions of the will dated 18/6/1994 are not applicable; they still apply in relevant areas. The court agrees with the argument that the residuary clause of the will applies in this case and doesn't lie in limbo. The court's injunction decree must consider statutory provisions and the limitations of copyright. The court also points out that certain acts, such as fair dealing for private use, research, criticism, and review, as outlined in section 52 of the act, do not constitute copyright infringement. Thus, if the performances fall under the scope of these clauses, the injunction order does not apply. Additionally, if performances are carried out by an educational institution or before a non-paying audience by an amateur club or society, they may not violate the injunction order.

[Facts] The appellant claimed to be a tenant of two adjacent premises, while the respondent was the landlord. The respondent alleged that the appellant had closed his business and unlawfully sublet the premises to a partnership firm named "Bharat Neon Signs," of which the appellant was also a partner. The main dispute was whether the appellant had sublet the premises or allowed the partnership firm to use them. Over time, the partnership firm underwent changes in its composition. The appellant and his father were involved in various partnership deeds. The landlord filed suits claiming subletting and non-use of the premises for the intended purpose. The appellant's subletting to the partnership firm was alleged. The lower court and an appeal court decreed in favor of the landlord, dissolving the partnership. The High Court reevaluated the evidence and concluded that the partnerships were a cover, and the partnership firm was actually a sub-tenant of the appellant.
[Ratio of the decision] The central issue in this appeal is whether the appellant and his father had sublet the premises in question in accordance with Section 13(1)(e) of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (referred to as the "Rent Act"). The matter involves interpreting the scope of Section 29(2) of the Rent Act. The appellant and his father were alleged to have formed a partnership with others to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling neon signs tubes. The main contention revolves around whether this partnership constituted a genuine partnership, as defined in the Indian Partnership Act, and whether the appellant was actually a partner. The court examined various partnership deeds and documents to ascertain the existence of a genuine partnership. The partnership deeds outlined the sharing of profits, assets, and liabilities among the partners. The appellant's role in the partnership was examined, and it was found that he was to share in the profits but not in the losses. The deeds indicated that the appellant and his father joined the partnership after its initiation. The court determined that the formation of a partnership was not inherently illegal or improbable, and the partnership deeds seemed to be acted upon. The court emphasized that a partnership involves an agreement to share profits and the carrying on of business by all or any of the partners acting for all. The court reviewed the legal principles related to partnerships and highlighted that the question of whether there was a genuine partnership was a mixed question of law and fact. The court then discussed the powers of revision, stating that the High Court's role is to ensure that the principles of law have been correctly applied, facts have been properly appreciated, the decision reached is reasonable, and there is no miscarriage of justice. The court cautioned against the High Court substituting its own view for that of the lower court unless the lower court's decision is not reasonably possible. In this case, the court concluded that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in revising the lower court's decision. The court of small causes had carefully evaluated the evidence and concluded that there was a genuine partnership. The High Court's differing view did not justify interference within the scope of Section 29(2) of the Rent Act. The court upheld the lower court's decision that the appellant had not sublet the premises, and the partnership did not lead to forfeiture of the tenancy.

[Facts] This appeal challenges a judgment from the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated October 3, 2007, where the appellant's appeal was dismissed and the conviction imposed by the Special Judge for CBI Cases was upheld. The appellant, who worked as a head clerk in the South Central Railway, was convicted of corruption charges involving the acceptance of a bribe. The appellant's duties included handling matters related to promotions, transfers, and other personnel-related issues. The complainant, a railway employee seeking a transfer, reported to the CBI that the appellant had demanded a bribe of Rs 200 for processing his transfer request. A trap was set, and the appellant was caught accepting the money. He was subsequently charged under Section 7 and Section 13(1)(d)(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The Special Judge convicted the appellant and sentenced him to six months of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 500 under Section 7 and to one year of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 500 under Section 13(1)(d)(ii), with both sentences to run concurrently. The High Court upheld this conviction and sentence. The matter before the Supreme Court was limited to the quantum of sentence. The appellant appealed against the sentences imposed by the lower courts. The case focused solely on the issue of the sentence, as the scope of the hearing was confined to this aspect. The appellant's counsel and the respondent's counsel were both heard on the quantum of the sentence imposed on the appellant. The appellant was convicted of the charges, and the sentence was the point of contention during this particular stage of the appeal process.
[Ratio of the decision] The decision clarifies that when a notice is issued confining arguments to a specific aspect (in this case, the quantum of sentence), the parties are not entitled to raise all points and reopen the case without restriction. The judgment emphasizes that the court will not ignore statutory provisions or act merely out of sympathy under Article 142 of the Constitution. The court analyzed the evidence presented in the trial and appellate courts, concluding that the appellant's conviction and sentence were appropriate given the statutory provisions and the seriousness of the offense. The court rejected the appellant's request for a reduction in sentence based on factors such as long delay and loss of employment. It highlighted that when the statute prescribes a minimum sentence, delay may not be a valid ground for sentence reduction. The court also emphasized that Article 142's power cannot supplant or ignore substantive provisions of the relevant statute, ensuring consistency with both constitutional rights and statutory laws. The court cited precedent to assert that Article 142's power is constitutional and not restricted by statutes, but it cannot be exercised in conflict with established statutory provisions. The judgment concurred with the trial court and the high court's conclusions and dismissed the appeal. The appellant's bail bonds were cancelled.

[Facts] This appeal challenges a judgment from the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated August 19, 2011. The appeal pertains to a case where the accused appellants were convicted under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The incident occurred on November 18, 1994, when a confrontation arose between the complainant, his sons, and the accused. The accused attacked the complainant party with weapons, causing injuries. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence and medical testimony. The accused claimed self-defense and denied their involvement. The injured party was severely wounded, including a head injury. One of the injured individuals required emergency surgery, and medical experts testified that without this intervention, the victim could have died. The trial court found the accused guilty of the charges, and the case was appealed to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The High Court partially allowed the appeal, modifying the conviction while still affirming certain charges. The case centers on the altercation, injuries sustained, and the medical urgency required for one victim's survival.
[Ratio of the decision] The court carefully considered the contentions and reviewed the evidence in the case. The incident involved the accused attacking the complainant and his sons with weapons during a confrontation over cutting pullas. The injuries were corroborated by medical evidence and the testimony of the injured witnesses. The court emphasized that for a conviction under section 307 IPC (attempt to commit murder), it's crucial to establish the accused's intention to commit murder and the act done by them. In the case of the second appellant, Rajbir (a 2), the court found his conviction under section 307 IPC to be valid. The court also discussed factors determining intention, such as the nature of the weapon used, the words spoken by the accused, the motive, the parts of the body targeted, and the severity of the injuries. Rajbir was sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment, but considering the circumstances, the court reduced the sentence to three years. Additionally, the court directed Rajbir to pay compensation of Rs 7,50,000 to the injured victim, Sukhbir. The court noted that the other accused, Jage Ram (a 1), Madan (a 3), and Rakesh (a 4), had already undergone a substantial period of imprisonment. Thus, their sentences were reduced to the period already served. The court took into account the nature of injuries, the passage of time since the incident, and the overall circumstances in determining the appropriate sentences and compensation in this case.

[Facts] This special leave appeal arises from a Bombay High Court judgment dated March 1, 2005. The High Court overturned an arbitral tribunal's decision that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim and counterclaim made by the parties. The dispute centered around a time charter party agreement between the appellant, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, and the respondent, Great Eastern Shipping Company Limited, for chartering a vessel. The charter party agreement was initially set to end on August 31, 1998. However, the parties extended it through correspondence, and there was a dispute regarding the charter hire rates beyond August 31, 1998. The Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC) acted as an agent for the appellant and communicated with the respondent regarding the charter party extension. The oil coordination committee and the tendering process were also involved. The arbitral tribunal ruled that it lacked jurisdiction as the charter party agreement had expired on August 31, 1998, and a new agreement with different terms existed. The respondent challenged this ruling in the Bombay High Court, which found that the charter party agreement had effectively continued beyond August 31, 1998, with the same terms and conditions except for the hire rates. The High Court emphasized that the vessel had not been redelivered as per the charter party's terms, and therefore, the original agreement was still in effect. The court held that the tribunal had misinterpreted certain clauses of the charter party agreement and that it did indeed have jurisdiction to decide the dispute. In summary, this case involves a dispute over the extension and terms of a charter party agreement for a vessel beyond its initial expiry date. The High Court found that the agreement had continued in effect, except for the hire rates, and thus the arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the matter.
[Ratio of the decision] The text examines legal questions in a vessel charter agreement dispute. The first issue is whether the arbitral tribunal can decide the claimant-respondent dispute from September 1998 to August 1999. This relates to the jurisdiction for the vessel "Jag Praja," as stated in the written statement. The second query explores if there's a common practice that if a vessel isn't re-delivered according to the charter's time frame, the original charter party terms remain valid. Another issue is whether the charter party dated May 6, 1997, ended naturally on August 30, 1998. The appeal questions the correctness of a High Court order. The central question revolves around whether the arbitration agreement between the parties terminated after August 31, 1998, when the extended charter hire period concluded. While acknowledging the broad scope of the arbitration clause, the text focuses on whether the arbitration agreement survived beyond August 31, 1998. The principle of "sub silentio" is discussed, suggesting that conduct can imply agreement even without explicit words. The correspondence between the parties is explored, including the respondent's protest of rate changes and the appellant's lack of response. The appellant's obligation to re-deliver the vessel according to specific clauses is emphasized. The failure to do so raises questions about the complete fulfillment of the charter party. The arbitral tribunal's decision on the vessel's non-delivery and the application of charter party clauses is critiqued for not considering this aspect as part of the arbitration agreement. The final consideration is whether, given the existence of an arbitration agreement, the dispute should be referred to the same tribunal that previously questioned its jurisdiction. In conclusion, the text dives into intricate legal aspects of a vessel charter dispute, from jurisdiction and charter termination to arbitration agreement survival, implied agreements, correspondence implications, vessel use, and tribunal decisions. The appeal is seen as lacking merit and is dismissed, with costs allocated to each party.

[Facts] The matter involves confusion stemming from the postponed commencement of the Patents Amendment Act 2005. This confusion arose due to the provision of different commencement dates for various parts of the same act. Span Diagnostics Limited filed an opposition to a patent application in 2000 under the Patents Act 1970 as amended by the Patents Amendment Act 1999. In 2002, the legislature aimed to create an appellate forum for patent-related appeals. The Patents Amendment Act 2002 was enacted but not immediately enforced. This act lacked provisions for post-grant opposition, which were introduced in the Patents Amendment Act 2005. Despite these changes, certain sections were not enforced simultaneously. The case highlights the complexity resulting from amendments and delayed enforcement of different sections of patent-related legislation.
[Ratio of the decision] The case revolves around the introduction of a dichotomy in patent law by the Patents Amendment Act 2005, separating opposition to pre-grant and post-grant patents. Amendments to Section 25 introduced this distinction, with different procedures for each type of opposition. The amended law allowed post-grant opposition within a year after patent grant. However, the enactment of certain sections, including Section 117a, was delayed. This led to confusion and legal challenges concerning the jurisdiction of appeals. In the context of these complexities, the court determined that the appeals filed prior to the enforcement of the new law, under the old provisions, should be heard and decided by the High Court. The Appellate Board, with jurisdiction over post-grant matters, couldn't consider these appeals. This case highlights the challenges arising from delayed enforcement and the resultant impact on legal proceedings.

[Facts] An FIR was filed based on the statement of Prakashi Devi, who claimed that the appellant trespassed her house, broke bulbs, and later touched her daughter-in-law, Sheela Devi. The police filed a report, and charges were framed against the appellant for house trespass and assault with intent to outrage modesty. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prakashi Devi and Sheela Devi testified, but discrepancies emerged in their statements regarding who was touched. The defense argued that the charge didn't match the evidence, but the courts rejected this technicality, stating an error in naming Prakashi Devi instead of Sheela Devi in the charge wasn't prejudicial and upheld the conviction. The case centers on allegations of trespass, assault, and modesty outrage.
[Ratio of the decision] The central issue is whether an accused can be convicted for an offense against a person (Y) when the charge is framed for an offense against a different person (X), even if the error in the charge did not prejudice the accused or lead to a failure of justice. The decision affirms the importance of accurately framing charges to ensure a fair trial. The court establishes the following principles: 1. Purpose of Charge Framing: The purpose of framing a charge is to provide the accused with a clear understanding of the offense they are being tried for and the essential facts they need to defend against. 2. Prejudice and Failure of Justice: If an accused is charged with an offense against person X but is convicted based on evidence related to person Y without a charge against person Y, this can prejudice the accused and result in a failure of justice. However, if the accused was aware of the error and defended themselves against the actual offense charged, there might not be prejudice. 3. Substance Over Technicalities: Courts should prioritize the substance of the case over technicalities. The accused should have had a fair trial, understanding the charge, knowing the main facts against them, and having a full chance to defend themselves. 4. Informed Defense: If the accused concentrated their defense on disproving the charges as framed, without trying to challenge evidence related to the actual offense committed, it indicates that they were defending against the actual charge and not the erroneous one. Applying these principles, if the accused was charged with trespassing and outraging the modesty of person X but the evidence relates to person Y, and the accused's defense was focused on disproving the charges against person X, then there's a likelihood of prejudice and failure of justice. In such cases, a new trial is warranted, charging the accused accurately based on the evidence and circumstances. The court emphasizes that the charge should contain particulars of the person against whom the offense was committed to ensure a fair trial.

[Facts] This case involves a dispute over the payment of bonus to workers. The appellant company faced a trading loss in 1949 due to various factors, including controlled selling rates, increased basic wages, worker indiscipline, strikes, and cotton shortages. Despite the loss, the company paid a dividend to shareholders and an ex gratia bonus to workers at a reduced rate. The workers' union sought a higher bonus rate through conciliation and legal proceedings. The regional conciliation board initially awarded the workers a higher bonus rate. The industrial court later reversed this decision, accepting the appellant's argument that a loss had been incurred and thus a higher bonus was unwarranted. However, the labor appellate tribunal, while agreeing with the loss assessment, deemed this a special case of social justice. They directed the appellant to pay the workers the higher bonus rate based on their formula. Both the industrial court and labor appellate tribunal acknowledged the trading loss incurred by the appellant in 1949. The labor appellate tribunal, despite concurring with the industrial court's finding of a loss, made an exception for the workers due to principles of social justice. The tribunal did not establish a link between bonus and dividends or claim that the workers had any rights to the company's reserves or undistributed profits. The tribunal's decision aimed at achieving social justice between all parties involved, as per their formulated approach, and this principle was accepted by the tribunal itself. The case highlights the complexity of determining bonus payments and the consideration of social justice in such matters.
[Ratio of the decision] The main question is whether workers are entitled to a bonus even when the employer faced a trading loss in the given year, and whether workers have any rights to company reserves and undistributed profits. The term "bonus" means a gift or boon beyond regular remuneration. It's also used in industrial relations to denote extra compensation beyond contractual wages. The demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim under certain conditions, such as when wages are below living standards and the industry earns substantial profits. A formula for granting bonus was established by the Labor Appellate Tribunal, which accounts for deductions like depreciation, rehabilitation reserves, and returns on capital before allocating surplus for bonus. Bonus is not a deferred wage and cannot be claimed during a year of trading loss. The workers have no legal right to company reserves or undistributed profits. Such claims would not survive as labor forces change yearly. The tribunal's introduction of social justice considerations is irrelevant and untenable, especially when workers' indiscipline and strikes contributed to the company's losses. The argument against interference with tribunal decisions based on Article 136 is countered by the court's power to intervene if a person is dealt with arbitrarily or unfairly by a tribunal or court within India, as established in previous cases.

[Facts] This case involves appeals by four accused individuals who were convicted of murder. The High Court of Chhattisgarh upheld the conviction by the Additional Sessions Judge. The victim, Bhavna Tripathi, was murdered in her home, leading to the arrest of the accused. Dr. Shardha Prasad Tripathi, the husband of one of the accused, lodged a First Information Report (FIR) upon discovering the crime scene. Bhavna's body displayed multiple incised wounds. An eyewitness, Anil Kumar, testified that the accused attacked Bhavna, leading to her death. Shashi Tripathi, the mother-in-law, was believed to be upset with Bhavna due to domestic disputes. The accused were found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
[Ratio of the decision] The court carefully examined the identification process and the boy's testimony in a case involving a murder. The boy, Anil Kumar, identified the accused individuals accurately despite not knowing them previously. This identification was crucial as the boy had no motive to falsely implicate anyone. The court believed his testimony and stated that his rural background and age were natural factors for his presence during the incident. The court dismissed arguments about possible police influence on the identification parade, noting the short period between arrests and parades. The court also discussed the need for corroboration of witness testimony but found the boy's identification reliable and specific. The court rejected appeals to previous cases and emphasized that common intention and conspiracy are inferred matters. Despite convicting some accused individuals, the court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of one individual, Mahesh, beyond reasonable doubt due to insufficient evidence of his involvement in the crime.

[Facts] The appellants have appealed against a judgment of the High Court dated 25th November 2009 in relation to the acquisition of their agricultural lands by the State of Uttar Pradesh for building the Shahjahanpur district jail. The appellants are landowners with transferable rights and reside in the village of Murchha in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The state government formed a committee to recommend the relocation of congested district jails to less populated areas. The old district jail in Shahjahanpur was overcrowded, and the committee proposed shifting it to new premises. A committee chaired by the Chief Secretary was formed to evaluate the shifting process and modernization of existing prisons. The committee recommended land acquisition for the new jail premises and the preparation of a detailed project report. The district magistrate forwarded the proposal for land acquisition to the state government, which issued notifications under the Land Acquisition Act on 21st August 2008 without conducting a Section 5A inquiry due to urgency. The appellants filed a writ petition against these notifications in the High Court under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution.
[Ratio of the decision] The appellants presented several arguments before the court. Firstly, they questioned the justification of the state government's acquisition of fertile agricultural land when less fertile barren land alternatives were available. Secondly, they challenged the state government's decision to bypass the inquiry mandated under Section 5A of the Land Acquisition Act, particularly considering the significant time gap between the notifications under Sections 4 and 6. The appellants asserted that the High Court had erred in upholding the urgency aspect without clear evidence that an inquiry under Section 5A would be against public interest. The court found merit in the appellants' arguments. The court discussed the principles surrounding land acquisition, emphasizing that the Land Acquisition Act is a drastic law with expropriatory implications, and the concept of public purpose in acquisition must align with the principles of a welfare state. The court noted that the definition of public purpose has evolved over time and must be in harmony with constitutional values, especially fundamental rights and directive principles. The court stated that judicial review is crucial in ensuring social and economic justice, and the concept of public purpose should not lead to the displacement of common people's homes in favor of specific interests. The court discussed the scope of a person's right under Section 5A of the Act, which provides for a hearing in cases of urgency. The court noted that urgency clauses should be invoked carefully, and the timeline in the case indicated no compelling urgency for the acquisition. The court emphasized that land acquisition must strictly adhere to the provisions of the Act and uphold the principles of social and economic justice. The court ultimately concluded that the acquisition in this case couldn't be justified under the urgency provision of Section 17 and recommended that acquisition proceedings follow the proper procedure and comply with Section 5A.

[Facts] The appellants, who were engaged in biscuit manufacturing, appealed against the Customs Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) decision dated 11th April 2000. They sold biscuits under the brand name "Meghraj." The issue arose when it was alleged that the appellants sold biscuits using a brand name owned by another company, Kay Aar Biscuits Pvt. Ltd., which had the registered trademark for "Meghraj" on its own products. The show cause notices were issued by the department demanding differential duty for certain periods, based on an agreement between Kay Aar Biscuits and another company, Rich Food Products Pvt. Ltd., where Kay Aar Biscuits allowed Rich Food Products to use its trademark for manufacturing wafers. The Assistant Commissioner concluded that the appellants were not eligible for the benefit of certain notifications due to their use of the "Meghraj" trade name. The appellants appealed to the Commissioner and subsequently to CEGAT. The Commissioner and CEGAT rejected the appeals, holding that the appellants were using the trade name "Meghraj" on their products, which was owned by Kay Aar Biscuits. The orders of the Commissioner were confirmed by CEGAT in April 2000. The appellants later sought rectification, arguing that the trade name "Meghraj" did not belong to Kay Aar Biscuits and that the department failed to prove it. They also mentioned an application they had made for ownership of the trade name. However, their rectification application was rejected by CEGAT in December 2000. Subsequently, the appellants appealed against the original CEGAT decision to the higher court under Section 35L of the Central Excise Act 1944.
[Ratio of the decision] The judgment outlines the reasons for rejecting the appellants' arguments and upholding the decisions of the lower authorities. Key points are as follows: 1. The registration certificate for the "Meghraj" trademark was issued to the appellants on 30th June 2000 with retrospective effect from 30th September 1991. However, this registration certificate doesn't automatically provide the benefit of exemption under the excise law. The registration under the Trade Marks Act doesn't necessarily grant exemption benefits in the context of excise law. 2. The objective of the exemption notification was to provide benefits to small-scale industries (SSIs) without established brand names. The notification aimed to increase industrial production for SSIs. 3. The exemption notification stated that the benefit was not available for excisable goods bearing the brand name or trade name of another person, whether registered or not. 4. The appellants argued that the trade name "Meghraj" was abandoned by Kay Aar Biscuits, but the court rejected this argument, stating that the burden of proving abandonment lies with the appellants, which they failed to do. 5. The issuance of a registration certificate under the Trade Marks Act with retrospective effect doesn't confer the benefit of exemption under excise law. The principle of deemed equivalence to public user, applicable in trade marks, cannot be extended to excise law. 6. The appellants' use of the "Meghraj" trade name was considered to trade on the reputation of Kay Aar Biscuits, which was not rebutted by the appellants. 7. The court concluded that the appellants wrongly used the trade mark of Kay Aar Biscuits and hence were not entitled to the benefit of the exemption notification. 8. The judgment is specific to the period covered by the impugned show cause notices and doesn't express an opinion on subsequent events. Overall, the court found no merit in the appeals and upheld the decisions of the lower authorities.

[Facts] This appeal is filed against the order of the Bombay High Court, which dismissed the appellant's Letter Patents Appeal. The case involves disputes over the ownership of certain properties. The properties in question originally belonged to Haji Habib Tar Mohammed Janu, who later sold them to Smt. Hajrabi Haji Yusuf in 1949. However, due to legal proceedings, these properties were treated as evacuee properties. The properties were auctioned, and Gulabbai Desai purchased them in 1956. Subsequent transactions and legal proceedings resulted in conflicting claims over the properties. The appellant, who was allotted some of the properties, disputed the mutations made in favor of other respondents. The case went through various stages of revision and appeal before different revenue authorities, with entries being canceled and reinstated multiple times. Ultimately, the State Minister for Revenue reinstated the entries in favor of the respondents, leading to the appellant challenging this decision in the Bombay High Court. The High Court upheld the State Minister's decision, stating that the minister had the jurisdiction to make the decision under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code. The appellant's writ petition and subsequent Letters Patent Appeal were both dismissed. As a result, the appellant has filed this appeal before the Supreme Court seeking a review of the decisions made by the lower authorities and the High Court, arguing that the State Minister's decision was not within his jurisdiction.
[Ratio of the decision] The key legal question in this case is whether a second revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code is permissible and whether the state government has the authority to entertain such a second revision. The court examined the relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and concluded that the state government holds a superior position in revenue matters. The Code establishes that the state government appoints revenue officers, including the commissioner, and exercises control and superintendence over all revenue matters. Even though there are provisions allowing certain revenue officers to exercise revisional powers, the state government's power to review decisions, including those made by other revenue officers, is preserved. The court clarified that the language used in the Code suggests that the jurisdiction of the state government to entertain a revision is concurrent with the jurisdiction of other revenue officers. This means that even if one party approaches a revenue officer for revision, the state government can still be approached for a separate revision. The court emphasized that the state government's power to review decisions and call for records is integral to its general power of superintendence and control over revenue matters. This authority allows the state government to ensure the legality and propriety of orders passed by various revenue officers. In summary, the court held that under the scheme of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, both the state government and certain revenue officers have the authority to exercise revisional powers. There is no indication in the Code that once a revenue officer with jurisdiction exercises revisional powers, a superior officer or the state government cannot further exercise such powers.

[Facts] The respondent worked as a technical assistant with the Gujarat State Electricity Board. He was promoted to deputy engineer and transferred to Ukai subdivision. He challenged the transfer order, citing his mother's illness, and filed a civil suit. In response, the Chief Engineer discharged him from service on March 31, 1974. The respondent challenged the discharge order in the High Court, which declared it void due to a lack of natural justice but didn't grant reinstatement or back wages due to the respondent's disobedience of orders. Both parties appealed, and the Division Bench upheld the single judge's decision but ordered reinstatement without breaks in service and 50% back wages. The appellant challenged this in the Supreme Court. During hearings, the court suggested dismissing the original writ petition without refunding amounts paid to the respondent, which he agreed to. However, the respondent later failed to appear before the court, so the court proceeded to decide the case. The respondent was transferred to Ukai and was relieved from his previous duties on March 30, 1974. Despite this, he didn't join at Ukai. The Chief Engineer discharged him on May 27, 1974, citing continued absence in breach of service regulations. Before this, the respondent was transferred on March 29, 1974, but didn't join the new post. He made a representation against the transfer, which was rejected, and he was directed to obey it. However, he didn't comply. The Chief Engineer then discharged him on May 27, 1974.
[Ratio of the decision] The appeal challenges the judgment and order of the High Court that allowed the respondent's writ petition, quashed his discharge order from service, and directed his reinstatement. The respondent misused adjournments to raise frivolous objections for transferring the case to another bench. Transfer of a government servant is an incident of service and a condition of employment. The respondent was transferred several times during his tenure. The power of summary discharge under Regulation 113 is valid, and it requires two conditions to be met: unauthorized absence and failure to join duty after a warning. The High Court's view that no warning was given is not sustainable as there is evidence of correspondence showing the respondent was warned. The Division Bench's finding that the letter of April 24, 1974, was raised for the first time is incorrect, and the respondent failed to rebut the presumption of service when a registered letter is returned with an endorsement of refusal. The respondent's non-compliance with the transfer order led to his discharge according to Service Regulation 113. The orders of the learned single judge and the Division Bench setting aside the discharge order were incorrect in law.

[Facts] In 1962, the Ministry of Defence acquired land for expanding the Sirsa airfield due to the Chinese invasion. The appellant, Major Som Nath, was accused of permitting the misappropriation of standing crops from the acquired land and accepting an illegal gratification of Rs. 3000 from the landholders. A case was registered against him under corruption charges. He was convicted for dishonestly allowing misappropriation of standing crops and misappropriating the money. He appealed to the High Court, which upheld the conviction. The government granted prosecution sanction under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The appellant's actions were considered offenses under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code. The appellant's involvement was related to allowing crops to be cut from the acquired land and not properly recording the handover in the site order book. The prosecution was based on these actions, and the appellant's conviction was maintained.
[Ratio of the decision] This appeal is against the conviction of the accused under Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court examines a submission by the appellant concerning the validity of the prosecution's sanction under Section 5(1)(c). The appellant's argument that the sanction doesn't cover the specific charge is rejected. The court emphasizes that a valid sanction must be related to the facts constituting the offense charged, even if the facts are not explicitly stated in the sanction itself. The court examines the order of sanction and concludes that the facts mentioned in it are sufficient to sustain the sanction under Section 5(1)(c). On the merits of the case, the appellant challenges the evidence and contends that certain evidence not put to him was relied upon by the courts. The court clarifies that while previous statements can be used to contradict a witness, the entire previous statement cannot be treated as substantive evidence. The court finds that the trial court and the high court's assessment of evidence is justified, and the appellant's denial of the existence of standing crops contradicts credible documentary evidence. The appellant's argument about witnesses not being called is dismissed as the prosecution had already provided evidence to establish its claims. In summary, the court addresses the appellant's challenges regarding the sanction and evidence, ultimately upholding the conviction.

[Facts] This appeal arises from a case involving the interpretation of phrases in the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. The case involves Subbammal, a woman worker in the plantation industry, who was allowed leave due to her pregnancy. After her delivery, she received maternity benefit for 72 working days within a 12-week period, excluding Sundays. Subbammal claimed benefit for the entire 84-day 12-week period, considering each week as 7 days. The labor court ruled in her favor, but the establishment appealed to the High Court. The single judge sided with Subbammal, determining that the 12-week period referred to 12 weeks of work. The establishment appealed, and the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court allowed her claim. The establishment now appeals to the Supreme Court. The question revolves around whether the 12-week period in the Act refers to actual working weeks or simply a continuous 12-week period. The Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides and expressed appreciation for the counsels' contributions.
[Ratio of the decision] In the case of Cochin v. [Case Name], the key question was the interpretation of the term "week" in relation to the Maternity Benefits Act. The Act provided maternity benefits to women workers for a maximum of twelve weeks, split into prenatal and postnatal periods. The dispute centered around whether the term "week" meant a cycle of seven days including Sundays or a cycle of seven days minus Sundays. The court examined various dictionary definitions and concluded that in the context of the Act, "week" should be understood as a cycle of seven days, including Sundays. The court emphasized that the legislature's intent was to calculate maternity benefits for the entire period of a woman worker's absence, including wageless Sundays. The term "period" in the Act was seen as emphasizing continuous time and the recurrence of the seven-day cycle. Given the Act's objective of social justice for women workers and its alignment with constitutional principles, a beneficent rule of construction was adopted to ensure women's well-being and efficiency. In light of this reasoning, the court rejected a previous ruling by the Kerala High Court that held a contrary view.

[Facts] The appeals under consideration stem from a shared judgment dated April 26, 2000, issued by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench, pertaining to similar legal and factual questions. Appellants 1 and 2 possess civil engineering degrees, while appellants 3 and 4 hold diplomas in civil engineering. Learning of available vacancies within the respondent authority, the appellants applied for these positions despite no official advertisement. The appellants were subsequently appointed and assigned to the "Indore Habitat Project," managed by the Overseas Development Authority (ODA), on daily wages. Eventually, their daily wage was raised to Rs 63 for degree holders and Rs 52.50 for diploma holders, and they were later receiving a monthly salary of Rs 1500, with provident fund deductions and leave benefits. The matter was referred to the Labour Court in Indore by the Madhya Pradesh government for resolution. Based on the evidence and arguments presented, the Labour Court determined that the appellants' work was satisfactory and comparable to employees of the Indore Development Authority. Dissatisfied with this outcome, the respondent authority filed a writ petition, leading to the impugned judgment of April 26, 2000, by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench, which favored the respondent authority.
[Ratio of the decision] The dispute in this case centered around whether the appellants' services were employed for the stated project or for the respondent authority. The appellants, who were initially engaged on daily wages, claimed that their services were not being regularized and filed an industrial dispute for relief. The questions before the court were whether non-regularization was valid and whether they were entitled to equal salary as others doing similar work. The respondent authority was required to strictly comply with constitutional provisions (Arts. 14 and 16) in its appointments as a state entity. The court found that the appointments were made in violation of the state's own regulations. The respondent failed to follow statutory procedures for recruitment, rendering the appointments void. The court emphasized that regularization cannot validate an illegal appointment. The court also noted that the nature of their engagement did not fulfill the conditions for permanent or temporary employment. The appellants' claim of regularization was not supported. The court further stated that the doctrine of "equal pay for equal work" could not apply to daily wage employees without sanctioned posts. Their employment was not in accordance with the statutory requirements, and thus, they were not entitled to regular pay scales. The court concluded that the appellants' appointments were invalid, their claims for regularization were not valid, and the doctrine of equal pay for equal work did not apply in this context. The appellants' plea was dismissed.

[Facts] The appellant, Ujjagar Singh, was convicted for the murder of his niece, Mukhtiar Kaur, and sentenced to death, along with additional convictions for offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case revolves around the incident where Mukhtiar Kaur was found dead with gunshot injuries, and Ujjagar Singh was also found injured. The accused was accused of killing Mukhtiar Kaur and attempting suicide. The appellant's family had disputes related to land, and Mukhtiar Kaur had left her matrimonial home to live with Ujjagar Singh prior to the incident. She had alleged that the land was fraudulently transferred from her mother. The prosecution presented witness statements, forensic evidence, and medical reports to support their case. During the trial, several witnesses changed their statements or turned hostile. The appellant claimed innocence, stating that he was falsely implicated and had a fatherly relationship with Mukhtiar Kaur. He denied the charges of harassment, murder, and sexual assault. Ultimately, the case hinged on conflicting witness testimonies, medical evidence, and the accused's defense of being falsely implicated.
[Ratio of the decision] The court reviewed the evidence and arguments presented in the case. It focused on the conviction under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and found that while there was evidence indicating the presence of semen from the victim's vaginal swabs and clothes, there was no evidence to suggest that the sexual intercourse had been non-consensual. The court noted that there was no physical evidence of rape or injuries indicative of sexual assault. The court acknowledged the importance of evaluating circumstantial evidence and referred to several previous judgments that emphasized the need to consider the facts of each case individually. The court discussed the circumstances of the case, including the location of the incident, the presence of the alleged murder weapon, and the absence of witnesses other than the accused and the deceased. It also noted that the trajectory of the gunshot wound suggested that the appellant had fired the weapon. While the appellant argued that there was no motive for the crime, the court stated that absence of motive alone does not necessarily disprove the prosecution's case. The court pointed out that sometimes the motive is known only to the accused. The court concluded that the appellant's claim that unknown assailants were responsible for the crime was not credible. The court found that the evidence supported the prosecution's version that the appellant had shot Mukhtiar Kaur and then attempted to commit suicide. In relation to the sentence, the court noted that the allegation of rape had not been substantiated, which led them to conclude that the death sentence was not warranted. In summary, the court found the appellant guilty of murder but not rape, rejected the claims of unknown assailants, and decided that the death sentence was not appropriate given the circumstances of the case.

[Facts] The appellants claimed to be tenants of agricultural land and filed a declaration seeking occupancy rights in the land. They alleged that they had been cultivating the land since 1968, but the respondent contested this claim, stating that the land was mortgaged and later redeemed. The case went through various legal proceedings, including a writ petition, an appeal, and a revision petition. The Land Tribunal initially allowed the application of the appellants' father, but the High Court set aside the decision and remanded the case for reconsideration. After remand, the Land Tribunal granted occupancy rights to the appellants based on RTC (Record of Rights, Tenancy and Crops) entries and other evidence. The Appellate Authority also upheld this decision. However, the respondent filed a revision petition in the High Court, which overturned the previous decisions. The High Court found that the appellants' evidence did not prove their tenancy, and their claims were inconsistent regarding the nature of their cultivation and the commencement of tenancy. The High Court emphasized that the father of the appellants failed to produce documentary evidence to establish his tenancy status. The High Court also noted that under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, a family member cannot be considered a deemed tenant if cultivating land owned by a family member. The High Court ruled that the evidence presented by the appellants was insufficient to prove their tenancy status, and therefore, they were not entitled to occupational rights. The High Court cited a previous decision in a similar case and held that when a person fails to prove tenancy, they cannot be granted occupational rights, even if they are in possession of the land. In summary, the appellants' claim for occupancy rights was rejected by the High Court due to lack of sufficient evidence to establish their tenancy status as required by the Karnataka Land Reforms Act.
[Ratio of the decision] The High Court had set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the lower tribunals under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1974. Despite the High Court's exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act, it's deemed inappropriate for the Supreme Court, using its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution, to interfere with this decision. After reviewing the appellants' and respondents' arguments, as well as examining the impugned judgment of the High Court and the lower tribunals' orders, the Supreme Court concluded that the High Court's decision was justified. The High Court was empowered by Section 121A of the Act to reevaluate evidence, examine legality, and determine regularity of proceedings. In comparison, Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) only allows interference based on jurisdictional errors or material irregularities. The Supreme Court clarified that the revisional power under Section 121A of the Act is broader than that under Section 115 of the Code. The High Court can examine legality, regularity, and evidence when deciding on the legality of orders under Section 121A. Applying this understanding, the Supreme Court found that the High Court was justified in its decision to set aside the concurrent findings of fact by the lower tribunals. The High Court had appropriately considered material evidence and concluded that the appellants had not proven their tenancy claims. The court highlighted the importance of payment of rent as a criterion for establishing tenancy and noted that entries in RTC records did not support the appellants' claim. The High Court's adverse inference against the appellants for not producing receipts or a lease agreement was also upheld. The Supreme Court also considered the possibility that even if the High Court's revisional jurisdiction was deemed inappropriate, it wouldn't be suitable for the Supreme Court to intervene under Article 136 of the Constitution. The High Court's view was plausible and aligning with the High Court's decision is warranted. Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, emphasizing the broader scope of revisional powers under Section 121A of the Act and the appropriateness of the High Court's judgment. It declined to interfere using its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution.

[Facts] The appellant was a tenant under respondent no. 4 for plot no. 17 8. A road widening project was proposed, leading to the acquisition of 867 sq m of land for the public purpose. The remaining 200 sq m of land was subject to proceedings for re-allotment under the Act. Respondent no. 4 was allotted a final plot (no. 157), and the appellant did not object. The scheme was notified in 1999, and the municipal corporation issued notices to vacate. The appellant challenged the notices, claiming lack of proper notice issuance for allotment and demolition. The High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal, noting that the plots were not contiguous.
[Ratio of the decision] The case revolves around the interpretation and application of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act 1976 and the related rules. The appellant, who was a tenant under respondent no. 4, was affected by a road widening project. Notices were issued, and land was acquired for the public purpose, leaving only a smaller portion. The appellant did not object to the scheme and did not participate in proceedings for allotment of the remaining land. The appellant challenged the process later, claiming lack of proper notice issuance. The court considers whether the appellant's conduct, which included not opposing the scheme and not participating in the proceedings, constitutes a waiver of his rights to challenge the allotment process. The court concludes that the appellant's conduct constitutes waiver and estoppel against asserting his rights at this point, as the benefit of the notice provisions was for his benefit alone and not related to public interests. Therefore, he cannot claim equitable relief now. The court also dismisses the idea of directing the appellant to compensate the respondent for the final allotment, as it is legally impermissible.

[Facts] The case concerns the grant of a proprietary jagir to the respondent by various hajur orders in the early 20th century. The jagir was abolished under the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act, 1953, with the respondent becoming entitled to compensation. An inquiry into whether the jagir was proprietary or non-proprietary was held, concluding that it was proprietary. The respondent then sought to assert his rights to quarry gravel and stones in certain villages through applications and entries in revenue records. The state initiated an inquiry into the respondent's rights to mines and mineral products in the villages under the Bombay Land Revenue Code, which the respondent opposed citing the earlier determination under the Jagirs Abolition Act. The dispute reached the Gujarat High Court through a writ petition. The appellants, the State of Gujarat and the Collector, challenged the High Court's decision. The case revolves around the question of whether the inquiry under the Land Revenue Code could be conducted despite the determination made under the Jagirs Abolition Act regarding the respondent's rights to minerals. The appellants' appeal challenges the High Court's judgment. In the past, the Mamlatdar had declared the respondent's rights to quarry gravel and stones in certain villages, which had been recorded in village records. The respondent's subsequent applications sought similar entries for another village based on the previous declaration.
[Ratio of the decision] The central question in this appeal is whether, once the competent authority declares a jagir (land grant) as proprietary under the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act, 1953, a further inquiry under the Bombay Land Revenue Code (BLRC) is valid to determine the rights of the jagirdar (recipient of the grant) to mines and mineral products within the jagir. The case involves the State of Gujarat and the Collector of Sabarkantha appealing the Gujarat High Court's judgment allowing the respondent's writ petition. The court addresses two specific questions: 1. Whether a subsequent inquiry under BLRC is permissible after a jagir is declared proprietary under the Jagirs Abolition Act. 2. Whether the particular inquiry initiated by the Collector into the respondent's rights to mines and mineral products was misconceived and unnecessary given the prior determination. The court determines that the purpose of the Jagirs Abolition Act is to abolish jagirs and calculate compensation based on whether they are proprietary or non-proprietary. The inquiry under Section 2(4)(i) of the Act aims to establish the quantum of compensation. The court establishes that the inquiry into proprietary nature doesn't necessarily involve mining rights and compensation isn't provided for mining rights. The court concludes that a further inquiry under BLRC is possible unless the proprietary determination is based on mining rights. In the specific case, the court concludes that the inquiry initiated by the Collector under BLRC was invalid as the respondent had already made applications for recognition of his rights to gravel and stones, and the inquiry was not relevant. The court also considers that a subsequent inquiry would be unfair to the respondent. The court further clarifies that while the specific inquiry into gravel and stones from the villages of Kapoda and Isarwada is quashed, the respondent can seek further inquiries if needed for other minerals. Any final determination on such rights must rest with a civil court. In summary, the court rules that a further inquiry under BLRC can be conducted after a jagir is declared proprietary, unless the proprietary determination is explicitly based on mining rights. In this specific case, the respondent's inquiry was invalid as it was unnecessary and unfair. The court upholds the High Court's decision to quash the inquiry and grant the injunction.

[Facts] The appellant challenges a judgment by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which dismissed their writ appeal on the grounds of non-maintainability. The appeal was filed under Section 21 of the M.P. Uchacha Nyayalay Khand Nyaypeth Ko Appeal Adhiniyam 2005 (referred to as the "Act"). The High Court determined that the order in question was made under the power of superintendence under Article 227 of the Indian Constitution. A special leave petition was initially filed with the Supreme Court against the order, which was disposed of on February 16, 2006. The High Court interpreted this disposition as waiving the time limit for filing a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA), but not explicitly directing consideration of the case's merits. The appellant sought to set aside the decision of the assessing officer in the writ petition.
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant's objection to the maintainability of the Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) is rejected by the court. The nomenclature used in the writ petition (Article 227) is not decisive; it is the nature of the relief sought and the controversy involved that determines the applicable article. The earlier order from the Supreme Court directed the High Court to consider the LPA on merits within three weeks and dispose of it if it was defect-free. The High Court's interpretation of the order as merely waiving the limitation for filing an LPA is incorrect. The High Court's judgment is also flawed in considering only the nomenclature of the writ petition rather than the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved. The appellant argued that the writ petition should be considered under Article 226 of the Constitution, but the respondent's invocation of both Article 226 and 227 in the writ petition makes the appeal against the learned single judge's judgment maintainable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The court's decision is that the primary objection to the maintainability of the LPA is rejected. The appellant's contention that the Letters Patent Appeal is not maintainable is not valid. The court further concludes that the High Court's decision on this matter is incorrect, and the appellant's appeal against the single judge's judgment is indeed maintainable.

[Facts] The appellant, a trust, sought permission to establish an engineering college and received conditional approval from the AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) based on expert committee recommendations. The AICTE provided specific conditions and general guidelines for approval, while the university listed the appellant as an affiliated college for the academic year. The state government later refused permission without giving reasons. The appellant filed a writ petition, and the single judge quashed the government's order and directed the university to consider permanent affiliation. However, the division bench allowed the government's appeal, setting aside the single judge's order. The division bench stated that the appellant could reapply for permission or request consideration for a future academic year. Point 1: The AICTE granted conditional approval based on expert committee recommendations, providing specific conditions and guidelines. The university included the appellant as an affiliated college for the academic year. The state government's refusal lacked reasons. The government's counter in court explained that the director of technical education had concerns about infrastructure compliance, which were sought by AICTE and the university. The government's counter also noted the need to assess the necessity for more engineering graduates and employment opportunities. The court reviews the background and context of the case, focusing on the appellant's application for establishing an engineering college, the AICTE's conditional approval, the university's inclusion of the appellant in affiliated colleges, and the state government's refusal without specific reasons. The government's counter highlights concerns about infrastructure compliance and the need to assess the demand for engineering graduates and job opportunities. The court addresses point 1, emphasizing the lack of detailed reasons for the government's refusal and the concerns raised in the government's counter.
[Ratio of the decision] The points of consideration in the case are as follows: 1. Whether, in light of the judgment in the "State of Tamil Nadu v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute," the AICTE Act 1987 covers the necessary approvals, rendering additional government or authority approval unnecessary and any state law requiring such approval void. 2. Whether the state government's rejection orders were valid on merits, and whether the university should have continued affiliation based solely on AICTE permission. The court reviews the "State of Tamil Nadu v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute" case, focusing on the central Act's provisions and relevant regulations. The AICTE Act aimed to coordinate and regulate technical education across India. The process of granting approval for new technical institutions involved consultations with various committees, councils, and experts. The court contrasts the Tamil Nadu case's principles with the current case's facts in the state of Kerala. It highlights that, even if Kerala had a law requiring government approval for technical institutions, such a law would be void due to the repugnancy established in the Tamil Nadu case. The AICTE Act 1987 occupies the field, and any state law requiring approval for establishing technical institutions would be unenforceable. The court examines the merits of the state government's refusal and the university's denial of further affiliation. It emphasizes that the AICTE Act's provisions hold supremacy in approving technical institutions, and the university's role is to consult with the state government and ensure conditions of approval are met. The court dismisses the university's reliance on a subsequent report, noting that any new information should be presented to the AICTE. In conclusion, the court sets aside the division bench's judgment and upholds the single judge's reasoning. The AICTE's approval is deemed sufficient, and the university's considerations should align with the AICTE Act and its regulations. The petitioner's request for reconsideration by the state government is rejected. Furthermore, the petitioner's case was already filed in the Delhi High Court, and the court finds it premature to proceed at this stage.

[Facts] This civil appeal is brought by special leave against a judgment and decree dated November 29, 1977, issued by a single judge of the Gujarat High Court. The appeal arises from Second Appeal No. 348 of 1973, which emerged from Regular Civil Suit No. 921 of 1966 filed in the Joint Civil Judge's Court, Baroda. The appellant, as the plaintiff, sought redemption of mortgaged properties from defendants 1 and 2, who were joined as parties. The plaintiff had borrowed money from defendant 1 and executed two mortgage deeds in 1961. The suit was filed in 1966 for redemption of the mortgages. The defense claimed that defendant 1 and his family were tenants of the properties and later became owners when the plaintiff purportedly sold the properties to defendant 1. The issue of tenancy was referred to the Mamlatdar under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948. The civil court, however, proceeded to frame issues and record findings without awaiting the Mamlatdar's decision. The civil court's findings were in favor of the plaintiff, establishing that the properties were not sold to defendant 1 after the mortgages were given and that the claimed past tenancy was not proven. The court granted a preliminary decree for redemption of the properties. Defendants' appeal to the District Court was dismissed, affirming the civil court's decision. Subsequently, the defendants filed a second appeal in the Gujarat High Court, challenging the judgments of the trial court and the appellate court. The single judge of the High Court allowed the second appeal, remanding the suit.
[Ratio of the decision] The appeal addresses two main questions. Firstly, whether the leasehold rights of a tenant merge into a mortgage security if the same property is given by the landlord to the tenant as mortgage security under a mortgage by conditional sale, preventing the tenant from resisting the landlord's suit for possession recovery by obtaining a redemption decree. Secondly, when a defendant claims to be a tenant of agricultural land under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act (BT&AL Act) and seeks a reference of the issue to the Mamlatdar (a competent authority under the Act) for a finding, can the civil court itself decide the tenancy issue and proceed with the suit based on that finding. The court clarifies that the doctrine of merger arises when a lesser estate merges into a greater estate. In this context, the court examines whether the leasehold estate of a tenant merges into a mortgage security created by the landlord if the same property is used as security for a mortgage by conditional sale. It is determined that if the landlord mortgages the leasehold property of the tenant to the tenant himself, the right of reversion remains with the landlord. Consequently, there is no merger as there's no inconsistency in the tenant being both the tenant and the mortgagee of the same property. The court also addresses whether a civil court can decide the issue of tenancy under the BT&AL Act if a defendant raises such a claim. The court points out that the BT&AL Act clearly assigns this duty to the Mamlatdar and restricts the jurisdiction of the civil court in such matters. Therefore, the court concludes that the civil court cannot decide the tenancy issue under the BT&AL Act. The court references a previous case (Topandas vs. Harkishandas) involving jurisdiction under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, and establishes that a defendant's claim cannot force a plaintiff into a forum that doesn't correspond to the true facts and nature of the case. In summary, the court decides that the leasehold of a tenant does not merge into a mortgage security, and a civil court cannot decide tenancy issues under the BT&AL Act if the law designates another authority for such decisions. The judgment under appeal is upheld.

[Facts] This case involves a dispute over trademark rights. The respondents registered the trademark "Raleigh" and other marks under various trademark acts. They entered into agreements to provide technical assistance for manufacturing bicycles using their trademarks. Subsequently, a company named Sen Raleigh Limited was formed and used the trademarks. The trademarks were also transferred to the appellant. Over time, the appellant alleged that the respondents had failed to provide technical assistance and claimed non-use of the trademarks. The appellant filed a suit seeking rectification of the trademarks under various sections of the Trademarks Act, alleging non-use, abandonment, and likelihood of confusion. The trial court dismissed the application, stating that the respondents' conduct was not violative of certain sections of the Act, and the division bench confirmed this decision on appeal. The key points of contention were whether unregistered licensees can use registered trademarks and whether the appellant's claim of non-use was valid. The court found that unregistered licensees could use trademarks as long as there was a trade connection with the licensor. Additionally, the court stated that the expression "by any registered proprietor" in the Act should not be restricted to only registered users but should also include bona fide authorized users. The court noted that the appellant failed to prove continuous non-use of the trademarks and lacked bona fide intention. The court also mentioned that the appellant's conduct was contradictory, as they sought both rectification and trademark registration simultaneously. Overall, the court upheld the dismissal of the rectification application, determining that the respondents' conduct did not warrant rectification of the trademarks.
[Ratio of the decision] The core question in this case is whether the High Court's decision to refuse the rectification and removal of the respondents' trademarks from the trademark register was correct. The court considered the provisions of Section 48 of the Trademarks Act, which defines permitted use of trademarks. It concluded that permitted use, under Section 48(1), must be by either the registered proprietor or a person registered as a permitted user. Unregistered persons or those not registered under Section 48(1) cannot be considered registered users under Section 46 or any other law. The court acknowledged that the appellant had used the respondent's trademark through agreements with Sen Raleigh, who was a registered user under Section 48. The court questioned whether the appellant could be deemed a bona fide user despite not having an agreement or registration as a permitted user under Section 48(1). The court noted that in the facts of the case, the appellant was a legitimate user in passing off bicycles under the respondent's trademark. The court discussed the importance of establishing a genuine trade connection between the proprietor and the licensee, with the intention to use the trademark at the time of registration. The court considered that the appellant's use of the trademark was not for trafficking but had a bona fide trade connection. The court also mentioned that even unregistered licensees could establish a trade connection through a course of dealings. The court addressed Section 46(3) of the Act, stating that it wasn't applicable due to the continuous use of the trademark by the appellant through Sen Raleigh. The court concluded that the High Court had properly exercised its discretion in refusing to rectify and strike off the trademark from the register based on the facts and circumstances of the case.

[Facts] In this case, the respondents faced trial for various criminal offenses, including conspiracy and misappropriation, under the Indian Penal Code. The respondents were initially convicted by the trial court, but they appealed their convictions to the High Court. The State also filed an application to revise the sentences given to the respondents. The High Court allowed the appeals, acquitted the respondents, and dismissed the State's application for revision. Dissatisfied with this outcome, the State of Andhra Pradesh appealed to the Supreme Court. The background of the case involved the Andhra Engineering Co., later converted to a private limited company, which obtained licenses to supply electrical energy. Due to financial constraints, a new company was formed to manage the energy supply business. Subsequently, various industrial concerns were started under the management of the original company. The first respondent was the managing director of the original company, and the second respondent managed the financial affairs. Misappropriation of funds and fraudulent accounting practices were alleged, resulting in charges against both respondents. Evidence revealed that misappropriation took place through various means, including falsely recording payments, using a private notebook to conceal transactions, and creating accounts to cover up discrepancies. A system of false entries and manipulation of accounts was used to embezzle significant amounts of money. The trial court found both respondents guilty of multiple charges, but the High Court acquitted them. The case involved complex financial transactions, misappropriation of funds, and fraudulent practices by the respondents. The lower court convicted them, but the High Court acquitted them, leading to the State's appeal to the Supreme Court.
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving multiple respondents and charges related to criminal activities within a company. The first respondent, Ganeswara Rao, was an old employee of AECO and was appointed as secretary of VESCO. The charges include criminal breach of trust, falsifying accounts, and using forged documents. The issue of whether there was a misjoinder of parties and charges is examined, referring to different clauses of the legal code, such as Section 239. The author argues that certain provisions in the code allow joint trials of multiple persons for offenses related to the same transaction. The court's interpretation of these provisions is debated, considering different scenarios involving various charges and respondents. The author concludes that these enabling provisions should be used to ensure efficient trials without infringing on legal provisions. The text discusses a legal case and its various aspects, including the validity of granting a pardon to an approver (a witness who participated in a crime and then provides evidence against associates in exchange for a pardon), the reliability of the approver's testimony, and the application of different legal provisions. The case involves arguments about the legality of granting a pardon to an approver under certain sections of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court analyzes whether the offences for which the pardon was granted fall within the scope of the relevant legal sections and discusses the authority of different types of magistrates to grant such pardons. The text also addresses the reliability of an approver's testimony, highlighting that the approver's motivation is primarily to receive a pardon, rather than sincere remorse. The court emphasizes that the reliability of the approver's testimony should be assessed based on the usual criteria for credibility, such as consistency, corroboration, and material particulars. The court's decision is to set aside the acquittal of the respondents and remand the case back to the High Court for further consideration. The High Court is instructed to reevaluate the evidence, considering the credibility of the approver's testimony and the corroborating evidence on specific charges, and then determine whether those charges have been proven or not. The court suggests that focusing on a few charges rather than all of them may be more efficient for the prosecution. Overall, the text outlines legal arguments related to granting pardons, evaluating approver testimony, and the process for reconsidering the case on its merits.

[Facts] The case revolves around the interpretation of Indian income tax laws related to agricultural income. The appellant, Mrs. Bacha F. Guzdar, was a shareholder in two tea companies that engaged in growing and manufacturing tea. The question was whether 60% of the dividend she received from these companies could be considered agricultural income and thus exempt from taxation. The High Court upheld the decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, agreeing that the dividend income could be considered agricultural income under the Indian Income Tax Act. This case is significant for its interpretation of the tax treatment of dividend income from agricultural activities.
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's main point is that the dividend received by a shareholder from a company is not considered agricultural income within the Indian Income Tax Act. The court reasoned that the dividend is not directly derived from the shareholder's connection with the land where agricultural activities take place. Dividends are the outcome of the shareholder's right to share in the company's profits based on their contractual relationship with the company. This right exists independently of any dividend declaration. The court distinguished between a shareholder's position in a company and a partner's role in a firm, emphasizing that a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. The court rejected the argument that dividends should be considered agricultural income just because they arise from profits accrued from land-related activities. The court stated that the definition of agricultural income in the Income Tax Act connects revenue directly to the land from which it originates. It concluded that dividend income, while originating from land-related activities, is not directly tied to the land itself and therefore cannot be classified as agricultural income. The court also rejected analogies between shareholders in a company and partners in a firm, asserting that the two situations are distinct due to the legal separation between a company and its shareholders. The court disagreed with the idea that a dividend's character as revenue derived from land remains unchanged when it reaches the shareholder's hands. It argued that this interpretation would lead to inappropriate exemptions and exceptions in the tax code. The court also cautioned against relying on English decisions when interpreting the Indian Income Tax Act, as they are based on different legal frameworks. In summary, the decision establishes that dividends received by shareholders from a company cannot be considered agricultural income under the Indian Income Tax Act, as they are not directly connected to the land's agricultural activities. The court emphasized the importance of analyzing the language and context of the Indian tax law itself to determine the meaning of terms like "agricultural income."

[Facts] The case involves a member of the Madras Legislative Assembly who was initially disqualified due to a conviction but sought exemption to run for a by-election. Despite his application being rejected by the Election Commission, he filed his nomination, won the election, and became a member. The Assembly's Speaker referred his disqualification to the Governor, who then sought the Commission's opinion. The member challenged this process in court, arguing that the disqualification existed before the election and should have been challenged through an election tribunal. The case revolves around the applicability of Article 192 of the Constitution in such a scenario. The member sought a writ of mandamus or prohibition against the Commission's reference.
[Ratio of the decision] The court held that the power of the high court to issue writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is subject to limitations: the writs cannot extend beyond the court's territorial jurisdiction, and the person or authority to whom the writs are issued must be within that jurisdiction. The court found that the High Court of Madras lacked jurisdiction to issue a writ against the Election Commission since the Commission was located in Delhi. Furthermore, the court examined the question of disqualification of a member of the legislature and whether the term "become subject to disqualification" in Articles 190(3) and 192(1) of the Constitution referred to disqualifications arising after election. The court agreed with the lower court's interpretation that these articles apply only to disqualifications incurred after a member's election. Therefore, the Governor and the Election Commission did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the respondent's disqualification, which had existed before his election. In conclusion, the court held that the High Court of Madras did not have the jurisdiction to issue writs against the Election Commission, and the term "become subject to disqualification" in Articles 190(3) and 192(1) referred to disqualifications arising after a member's election. The appeal was dismissed.

[Facts] The case involves a respondent who was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The initial investigation by Subinspector Mathur was conducted without obtaining the required permission from a magistrate. Later, Mathur received permission and conducted a detailed investigation, leading to the submission of a charge sheet. The respondent was convicted by a Special Judge but was acquitted by the High Court on the grounds of irregular investigation. The Supreme Court reviewed the case and found that Mathur's preliminary actions amounted to an investigation, despite the lack of permission initially. The Court emphasized that irregularities in investigation alone cannot lead to acquittal unless they seriously prejudice the accused. The Court concluded that there was no prejudice in this case and upheld the conviction of the respondent.
[Ratio of the decision] The court determined that the accused's conviction should not be set aside due to irregularities in the investigation process. The initial investigation by Subinspector Mathur was conducted without proper permission, violating the Prevention of Corruption Act. However, Mathur rectified this by subsequently obtaining the required permission from a magistrate of the 1st class. This resulted in a practically fresh and compliant investigation. The court held that the accused wasn't prejudiced by the initial irregularity, and thus, the conviction shouldn't be overturned solely due to investigation irregularities. The court emphasized the need for a strong connection between the irregularity and the conviction to warrant overturning a conviction. In this case, as the trial was fair and the evidence compelling, and the defect in the investigation was rectified with a proper investigation, no prejudice was caused to the accused. The court criticized the high court's focus on the initial irregularity and its failure to consider whether the accused was prejudiced during the trial. Therefore, the accused's conviction was upheld, and the curative provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not invoked.

[Facts] The appellant company purchased surplus materials through contracts and disputes arose with the Union of India, leading to arbitration. The umpire's award required the appellant to pay the respondent a certain amount. The appellant applied to set aside the award, claiming that it suffered from errors and misconstructions. They argued that the umpire failed to consider certain documents, misinterpreted the scope of sales, and acted beyond jurisdiction. Specifically, the dispute included questions about vehicles sold and removed by the appellant. The umpire determined the term "reverse land lease" and whether certain vehicles were covered by the sale. The High Court confirmed the award. The appellant's arguments centered on contract misconstructions, omitted evidence, jurisdiction issues, and errors in the umpire's findings.
[Ratio of the decision] The ratio of the decision revolves around the interpretation of the Arbitration Act (1940), Section 30 regarding the setting aside of an award due to an error apparent on the face of the award. The case involved a dispute between the Director General of Disposals and a company over the sale of vehicles and stores. The key points of the decision are as follows: 1. When parties select an arbitrator to resolve disputes, they cannot object to the decision based on law or facts if the award is sound on its face. 2. An arbitrator's findings, even on questions of law, are binding unless they are unsound on the face of the award. The award must show that the arbitrator considered evidence and arguments. 3. If an arbitrator refers to a legal point and its resolution is not apparent on the face of the award, it doesn't amount to an error justifying intervention. 4. When parties refer disputes to arbitration, a broad arbitration clause gives authority to the arbitrator to decide even on points of law, unless the award is fundamentally unsound in interpreting the clause. 5. If a dispute relates to compensation for vehicles removed by one party, and if the arbitration clause covers disputes "arising under" or "in connection with" the contract, the umpire's jurisdiction extends to determining compensation. 6. The scope of an arbitration clause is broad, and if it covers interpretation disputes about sale notes, it covers disputes about clarifications and assurances made post-sale. 7. An arbitrator's decision, even if based on a legal proposition, is not necessarily unsound on the face of the award. The mere consideration of a legal point doesn't incorporate a document into the award. 8. An arbitrator's findings should be based on the wording of the contract. A general reference to the contract doesn't incorporate it into the award. 9. An error must be evident from the face of the award, and the court shouldn't look beyond to determine if documents were misconstrued. 10. Once an umpire determines that vehicles were wrongfully taken, the umpire must order either their return or compensation. This doesn't exceed jurisdiction, as it relates to disputes arising under the contract. 11. The award of costs is at the umpire's discretion and should consider various factors, such as the volume of evidence and days spent arguing the case. 12. A court shouldn't intervene in an award's discretion or legality unless there's a clear basis under the law. The decision establishes that an error must be evident on the face of the award itself for it to be set aside, and the arbitrator's jurisdiction under a broad arbitration clause can extend to questions of law if not fundamentally flawed.

[Facts] In a legal case dated April 11, 1969, involving civil appeal number 165 of 1974 and related matters, the court dismissed the appeal and special leave petitions. The court ordered an ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to the appellant as a final settlement for their claim. It was directed that the respondents must deposit Rs 50,000 within three months in the trial court. The case originated from a judgment by the Kerala High Court on October 22, 1973, in S.A. No. 580 of 1970. The court held that the interpretation of a certain section by the High Court was incorrect, specifying that protection under the law should apply to those with lawful occupation, not unlawful occupation due to trespass or forceful entry. The court ruled in favor of the appellant, awarding them the ex gratia payment and dismissing the special leave petitions. The deposited amounts with the trial court could be withdrawn by the respondents.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the High Court interpreted Section 7d and determined that its benefits applied only to those whose land occupation had a lawful origin. The appellant's possession was found to be a result of trespass, and their claim of adverse possession as the owner was rejected. The High Court's decision to deny protection under Section 7d was upheld. The case revolved around the interpretation of Section 7d, which pertains to the status of tenants in relation to land reforms. The court stated that the section intended to protect those with lawful land possession, such as those who believed they could later seek government assignment or leased land from competent lessors. The appellant's claim of adverse possession was deemed insufficient for protection under Section 7d. The appeal was dismissed, and the court directed an ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000, with the observation that this decision did not affect the matter of rubber tree ownership.

[Facts] In this legal case, plaintiffs filed a suit against defendants claiming ownership of a disputed property. The plaintiffs' contention was that the property came to them through inheritance, while the defendants claimed perpetual lease. The trial court initially decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiffs, but an appeal was filed and remanded for consideration of the plea of prescription. The judicial commissioner concluded that the defendants failed to prove full title acquisition through prescription. The court also dismissed the defendants' claim of perpetual lease. The appellate court then evaluated the evidence, finding that the plaintiffs had been in continuous possession of the entire land, including the part with the defendants' house. The court observed that even though the plaintiffs' claim to the property was based on prescription, they themselves had constructed their house only in 1920. The court upheld the plaintiffs' ownership declaration for the part of the land without the defendants' house, while rejecting their claim against other occupants. The defendants were directed to remove their house and return vacant possession of the plot to the plaintiffs. The court expressed no opinion on the claims of other occupants not involved in the suit.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the defendants, who are the appellants, were being sued by the plaintiffs for ownership of a disputed property. The plaintiffs claimed peaceful and continuous possession for over 50 years, leading to title by prescription. The defendants initially opposed the construction by the plaintiffs on a part of the land but later agreed. However, the defendants denied the plaintiffs' title to the part where the defendants' house stood and showed open hostility to the plaintiffs' claim. The judicial commissioner concluded that the defendants' possession was not permissive and that there was no overt act of possession to the knowledge of the plaintiffs. The court interpreted Portuguese civil code articles on possession and prescription. It was found that permissive possession is insufficient to establish title and that the defendants' long and open possession with repudiation of the plaintiffs' title had ripened into ownership. The court determined that the plaintiffs had also acknowledged the land as the defendants' property, and the defendants' possession had lasted for many years, establishing the plea of adverse possession. The court partly allowed the appeal, decreeing the plaintiffs' claim to title but not granting their claim for eviction.

[Facts] The petitioners filed a petition under Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1973, along with Order XXXVI of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966. This was done during the investigation stage of their case, seeking a transfer of their case to a different court. However, the court dismissed their petition for transfer.
[Ratio of the decision] The court clarified that while Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the transfer of appeals from one high court or subordinate court to another, it does not grant authority to transfer investigations from one police station to another across the country merely based on the forwarding of initial information or remand reports to a court. The petitioners had misunderstood the scope of Section 406. Since there was no pending case before any court, the court dismissed the petition. The court advised that if the petitioners were concerned about the inconvenience of travel or judicial process, they should seek appropriate remedies through other means, as justice should be pursued without causing harassment. The court emphasized that courts should use their processes to advance justice, not to cause undue hardship to parties.

[Facts] In this case, Smt. Ishroo Devi filed a suit to recover certain properties based on a will executed by Purohit Mani Ram. The appellants, who were the son, wife, and granddaughter of Mani Ram, contested the suit, alleging that the will was forged and the properties were ancestral and thus could not be disposed of by a will. The trial court accepted the evidence of witnesses who attested to the authenticity of the will and ruled in favor of the respondent. The trial court found that two of the properties were ancestral, and the will was valid. The appellants appealed to the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir, which modified the lower court's decision, holding that one of the properties was ancestral, while the other two were self-acquired. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of India under Article 133 of the Constitution. The trial court's acceptance of the evidence supporting the validity of the will and the status of the properties was upheld by the Supreme Court.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court examined the validity of a testamentary will that disposed of ancestral property to a distant relative. The main issues addressed were whether the will was valid under the Jammu & Kashmir Hindu Succession Act and whether the income of a hereditary priest could be considered as ancestral property. The court found that the will was valid, rejecting claims of forgery and unnaturalness. It also determined that income from a hereditary profession is not joint family property and confirmed the status of certain properties as self-acquired or ancestral. The court held that under the Jammu & Kashmir Hindu Succession Act, a wife has a share equal to that of a son and remitted a question about the extent of the interest that could be disposed of by the will back to the high court for further consideration.

[Facts] In this case, a writ petition was filed to challenge an order of detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974. The petitioner argued that the order of detention should be quashed. The detenu, after being served with the detention order, submitted a representation on September 27, 1979, which the government received on September 28, 1979. The detenu's representation raised several points. The court held that under Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 22 of the Constitution, the detenu has a dual right: 1) the right to have the representation considered, irrespective of the length of detention, and 2) the right to challenge the legality of the detention. The court's judgment was delivered by Justice Fazal Ali.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court considered the issue of delay in deciding a representation filed by a detenu under Article 22(5) of the Indian Constitution. The court affirmed that the constitutional right to file a representation implies that it must be disposed of as quickly as possible. Any unexplained delay in deciding the representation would violate the constitutional guarantee. The court emphasized that the obligation of the detaining authority to decide the representation is distinct from the obligation to constitute a review board. The court held that the detaining authority cannot wait for the board's opinion and must decide the representation promptly. In this specific case, the representation was not explained or detailed in a timely manner, which rendered the detention void. The court's decision highlighted the importance of promptly considering and disposing of representations to uphold the rights of the detenu.

[Facts] Special leave was granted by the court, and a delay of six days in filing the case was condoned. The central issue pertained to the interpretation of the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948. Amendments were introduced to the Act through notifications, including Notification No. 4064/X-960/4-58 dated 14th December 1957 and Notification No. 4064/X-960/4-58 dated 25th November 1958. These notifications exempted cotton fabrics from sales tax. Subsequently, on 1st December 1973, another notification was issued that brought cotton fabrics under the purview of sales tax, specifically within Item No. 18 of the schedule as added by Section 4 of the said Act.
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled on the issue of taxation based on notifications under the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act. The notifications in question included one from 1958 that exempted cotton fabrics of all kinds from sales tax, and another from 1973 that imposed sales tax on beltings of all kinds. The court held that the exemption for cotton fabrics would prevail over the later notification, and thus, patta, treated as cotton fabric, would remain exempt from sales tax. The court stated that the power to grant exemptions and vary tax rates rested with the state government, and the absence of a notification withdrawing an earlier exemption did not prevent the imposition of tax through a subsequent notification. The majority judges held that the exemption applied as long as it existed, even if specific items were notified for taxation under a different provision. One judge dissented, arguing that the specific item notification under a later provision could not override the general exemption under the earlier provision.

[Facts] The case involves a joint family business with a sugar factory. After partition, the family formed a partnership and operated the factory. Partners' shares were auctioned every five years. One partner leased his share to the appellant, and another partner sued to cancel the lease. Eventually, both leases were terminated by mutual agreement. The question was whether the amounts received from these partners were taxable as income. The Income Tax Officer disallowed a claim for interest payment on a loan taken to buy shares in the sugar factory. The case was referred to the High Court, which ruled that the lease termination amounts were assessable income and upheld the disallowance of the interest payment claim. The receiver of the factory claimed enhanced depreciation allowance based on the value of a partner's share, but the claim was rejected. The appellant appealed against these decisions.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the appellant received amounts from partners due to lease termination, claimed depreciation on a 1/6th share in a sugar mill acquired through exchange, and sought to set off an unabsorbed loss against income. The court held that the amounts received were taxable income as they were in the nature of profits from business interest. Depreciation couldn't be claimed for a fractional share, and the claim for set off was denied as the business nature differed. The appellant's appeals were dismissed in all instances.

[Facts] This legal case pertains to the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973, involving sections such as 3, 4(1), 15(2), and 40(1). The act introduced changes to the earlier Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, which aimed to determine ceiling areas for agricultural holdings. A notified date was established, and subsequent amendments were made. In 1973, a new ordinance repealed certain provisions and recognized specific transfers made during the old law's operation. This ordinance was replaced by the 1973 Act, retroactively effective. The dispute involved proceedings for ceiling area fixation under the repealed chapter and whether they could continue after the 1973 Act's enforcement. The High Court upheld the validity of ongoing proceedings, stating that the new Act did not nullify accrued rights. The case revolved around the interpretation of these legal changes and their implications on ceiling area determination for agricultural holdings.
[Ratio of the decision] In the decision's core, the court considered whether certain provisions of the old law should be upheld despite the enactment of the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973. The court examined if rights had accrued and liabilities were incurred under the old law, allowing its continuation in pending cases. The court analyzed whether the new law's provisions expressed an intention to eliminate these rights and liabilities. The court held that the new law did not erase accrued rights and incurred liabilities under the old law, and specific indications within the new law supported this interpretation. The court addressed arguments regarding the applicability of Section 6 of the Rajasthan General Clauses Act, 1955. It emphasized that the mere absence of explicit reference to Section 6 was not conclusive and that the new law's intent must be considered. The court concluded that Section 6 would not apply to exclude the old law. Further, the court examined whether there were rights accrued or liabilities incurred under the old law in the pending cases. The court determined that the liability to surrender surplus land and the right of the state to excess land were not inchoate, but rather accrued and incurred. Thus, the provisions of the old law were applicable to these cases. The court affirmed that the new law did not extinguish rights and liabilities under the old law, and that pending cases should be decided accordingly. It found that the new law's provisions and internal evidence supported this interpretation. Additionally, the court highlighted that certain provisions allowed re-opening cases that were determined under the old law. The court held that the saving provision in a repealing statute was not exhaustive and that the rights and obligations saved or surviving were not limited to the saving provision's scope. The court also addressed contentions related to the applicability of Section 3 of the Rajasthan General Clauses Act, stating that it did not have an overriding effect to exclude the old law. The court concluded that the accrued rights and liabilities were sufficient to invoke the old law's provisions for pending cases, and that the new law's provisions did not eliminate these rights and liabilities. In summary, the court's decision determined that accrued rights and incurred liabilities under the old law were preserved and applicable to pending cases, despite the enactment of the new law. The court's analysis focused on the interplay between the old and new laws, the intent of the new law's provisions, and the scope of the saving provision.

[Facts] This case involves an appeal against the dismissal of a writ petition by the Allahabad High Court. The appellant's service as a junior engineer was terminated by the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam (a statutory body) due to unsatisfactory service records and an adverse entry in 1978-79. The appellant contended that his termination was mala fide, linked to his role as the president of a local union, and challenged the termination order before the U.P. Public Services Tribunal, which rejected the claim. The tribunal found the termination not punitive but based on service assessment. The High Court upheld the tribunal's decision. The appellant appealed against this to the Supreme Court. The appellant's contention that the termination was mala fide due to his union activities was dismissed. The court found that the service record indicated unsatisfactory performance, including recent poor ratings and adverse entries. The tribunal and the High Court's decisions were upheld, and the court dismissed the appeal, ordering the appellant to be paid Rs 75,000 by the Jal Nigam within three months.
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's key points are as follows: 1. The appellant was a permanent employee with 16 years of service, and his service was found satisfactory for making him permanent. 2. Proper assessment of service records was conducted, and the termination order was passed according to the rules by giving one month's salary in lieu of notice. 3. The appellant's contention that the termination was mala fide and unjust was not accepted. 4. The court highlighted that for compulsory retirement, stale adverse entries from over ten years ago should not be considered, and only recent service records should be taken into account, provided adverse entries had been communicated to the employee. 5. The appellant argued that the termination order was unfair and unjust, as it deprived him of suitable job opportunities at a later stage in life. 6. The court held that in this case, there was no requirement to give the appellant an opportunity to be heard before correcting the mistake in the order of confirmation. 7. The order of confirmation was found to be illegal and in violation of the interim order of injunction. 8. The appellant's claim that the order of termination was without stigma and not punitive was upheld by the High Court. 9. Despite not interfering with the termination, the court directed the U.P. Jal Nigam to pay Rs 50,000 as ex gratia to the appellant within four months. In conclusion, the appellant's appeal was dismissed, and while the court did not interfere with the termination, they directed the U.P. Jal Nigam to pay the appellant Rs 50,000 within four months.

[Facts] In this case, the appellant challenged his dismissal from service through a series of legal actions. The appellant's suit challenging the dismissal order was decreed by the district munsif and upheld by the district judge. However, the High Court dismissed the suit on the grounds that complex factual issues were involved. The appellant had previously filed a writ petition against the dismissal order, which was dismissed by the High Court, stating that the matter involved intricate questions of fact. The appellant then filed a suit challenging the dismissal's legality, which was decreed by the trial court and upheld by the district judge. The High Court also upheld the dismissal's invalidity due to a violation of statutory provisions. References to previous cases were made to support the appellant's arguments. Ultimately, the legal proceedings revolved around the appellant's dismissal from service and whether the dismissal order was valid under the law.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the appellant's dismissal from service was challenged in court. The appellant's suit was dismissed by the High Court on two grounds: 1) Civil court lacked jurisdiction due to the provision under the Jammu and Kashmir Government Servants (Prevention of Corruption) Act, 1962, and 2) The suit was barred by res judicata based on a previous writ petition. The appellant's argument that the jurisdiction of the civil court was not ousted by Section 20 of the Act was supported by legal references, including the case of Ram Swarup v. Shikar Chand, where it was stated that the section would not operate when the impugned order is a nullity. The appellant also contended that the principle of res judicata did not apply, as the previous writ petition had not addressed the merits of the grievance. The High Court's reliance on certain observations made in the previous proceeding was deemed erroneous. The Supreme Court concluded that the dismissal order was passed in violation of a mandatory provision and was therefore null and void. Despite this, the proper course of action was not to automatically set aside the dismissal order, but rather to require the employer to furnish a copy of the proceeding to the appellant and assess whether the failure to provide the copy had prejudiced the appellant's case. The Court directed the High Court to decide this matter and disposed of the case.

[Facts] The appellant in this case, M/s United Glass Bangalore, is a manufacturing unit within the Khoday group of industries, engaged in bottling alcoholic beverages. They established their own bottle manufacturing unit, and the dispute is about the valuation of the bottles produced from 1st July 1979 to 30th June 1983. The appellant filed two price lists that were provisionally approved, but the excise authorities found them to be significantly below the cost of production. They issued show cause notices proposing to redetermine the values of the bottles. The Collector of Central Excise confirmed the proposed values, and the appellant's appeal was allowed by the Collector (Appeals), who directed valuation based on sale prices to others. The Collector of Central Excise appealed to the Customs, Excise, and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, which found that the appellant's declared prices were far below cost and unacceptable. The Tribunal determined that the valuation of the bottles should be based on prices charged by another manufacturer, Alembic Glass Industries, for comparable bottles. However, the Tribunal's decision was inconsistent and dual, as it sometimes used Alembic's prices and sometimes the appellant's declared prices as the basis of assessment. The key issues are the valuation of the bottles produced by the appellant and whether the determination should be based on section 4(1)(a) or 4(1)(b) of the Act. The tribunal's decision to adopt different valuation bases for different situations was criticized, and it was stated that the appellant's prices should be uniformly compared to those of Alembic.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the respondents are directed to pay differential duties as the department is entitled to finalize assessments based on the value of goods supplied within the Khoday group. The Central Excise Valuation Rules of 1975 govern the valuation of excisable goods under Section 4(1)(b) of the Act. Rule 6 allows for valuation if the goods' value can't be determined under other rules, requiring the price at which the goods would be sold in wholesale trade to a non-related person. Rule 7 pertains to cases where the goods are not sold but used in production. The rule states that when the manufacturer doesn't sell the goods but uses them in manufacturing, the value of comparable goods sold by another assessee can be adopted as the basis for valuation. The appellant argues that once the revenue adopts a value, it cannot switch to another basis, which the court disagrees with, stating that such a stance isn't supported by the law.

[Facts] In this case, the appellant is challenging a land acquisition process. A notification was issued in 1985 to acquire 5 acres and 21 gunthas of land for the construction of the Hemavathi left bank canal. The Land Acquisition Officer initially awarded compensation at Rs. 4800 per acre, but the Civil Judge later increased it to Rs. 20000 per acre based on evidence of the crops being grown. The appellant contended that they cultivated sugarcane, hybrid jowar, and mulberry, yielding Rs. 25000 per acre. The High Court upheld the Rs. 20000 per acre compensation. The appellant now appeals to the court for a compensation of Rs. 10000 per acre with additional amounts and interest.
[Ratio of the decision] After examining the case's details, it has been concluded that a reasonable compensation of Rs. 10000 per acre is appropriate. The judgment referring to Ex. A3 (a document) has been presented, but it pertains to land with coconut trees and is irrelevant for this case's compensation determination. The respondent is entitled to enhanced compensation.

[Facts] In the given case, the appellants were accused of murdering a gram sarpanch. The trial court convicted several persons, but the High Court acquitted most of them and reduced the sentence for others. The incident occurred when the victim was attacked by the accused with lethal weapons. The prosecution claimed that the motive was political rivalry. The deceased's son and the state of Andhra Pradesh filed separate appeals against the High Court's decision. The Supreme Court analyzed the evidence and found the High Court's judgment erroneous. The Court found that the offence was established under section 302 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code and overturned the High Court's decision, convicting and sentencing the accused accordingly. The Court also discussed the reliability of witnesses and their motives.
[Ratio of the decision] In the given case, the Supreme Court found that the High Court's decision to convict the accused only of the offence under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code was erroneous. The Court determined that the assailants who participated in the brutal attack resulting in the victim's death cannot escape conviction under section 302 with the aid of section 34, if not section 149. The Court assessed the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies and highlighted inconsistencies and doubts regarding their claims. The Court observed discrepancies in the witnesses' accounts, their relationship with the deceased, and their presence at the scene of the occurrence. As a result, the Court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were the assailants who attacked the deceased. The appeal of two of the accused was allowed, and their convictions were set aside.

[Facts] This case involves an appeal arising from a Karnataka High Court order dated 19th September 1990. The respondents, Doddaramaiah and Chikkaramaiah, were granted agricultural land under Rule 43(8) of the Mysore Land Revenue Code. They filed an application for restoration of the land under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978. The appellant, who obtained title to the land after the expiry of ten years from the government assignment, claimed title by adverse possession. The appellant contended that there was no prohibition against him and cited precedent to support his argument. The issue revolves around whether the respondents challenging the sale of land to the appellant are estopped from doing so and whether the sale is valid, along with considering whether the appellant perfected his title by adverse possession.
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978, which prevents the alienation of assigned land intended for the economic betterment of marginalized communities. The appellant had acquired the land through a registered sale deed before the act was enacted. Article 46 of the Constitution emphasizes economic justice for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and weaker sections. The court noted that the right to economic justice is a fundamental right that aligns with liberty. Rule 43A specifically prohibits alienation of assigned land and does not impose a time limitation. The argument that the appellant acquired the land before the act and perfected his title through adverse possession was rejected. The court emphasized that adverse possession must involve disclaiming original title and asserting possessory title against the true owner, which wasn't the case here. The court's earlier decision (Veeranna vs. State of Karnataka) on the same issue affirmed that adverse possession does not apply against the state unless the purchaser has a valid title. As the proceedings were initiated within 30 years, the question of estoppel against the respondents didn't arise. The court concluded that the Act's prohibition on alienation applies to the situation, emphasizing economic justice for marginalized sections of society.

[Facts] The appellant was dismissed from service based on a dismissal order dated April 24, 1987, issued by the employer (respondent no. 1) following an inquiry into charges against the appellant. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 stipulates that during the pendency of industrial dispute proceedings, an employer can seek approval for dismissal from the relevant authority if the employee has been paid wages for one month. Respondent no. 1 applied for approval of the dismissal order before the Industrial Tribunal and later sought to withdraw the approval application. The appellant challenged his dismissal through an industrial dispute, and the state government referred the dispute for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal. However, respondent no. 1 applied to withdraw the approval application. The Industrial Tribunal dismissed respondent no. 1's withdrawal application, which was later challenged in a writ petition filed in the high court. In a judgment dated February 11, 1998, the learned single judge of the high court set aside the Industrial Tribunal's order and directed it to allow the withdrawal of the approval application. The high court's reasoning was not provided in the summary. The case was brought before the Supreme Court to review the high court's judgment and determine whether the withdrawal of the approval application should be allowed. The Supreme Court also mentioned the necessity to remand the matter back to the high court for a fresh decision on the writ petition.
[Ratio of the decision] The Supreme Court reviewed the case and found that the reasons given by the High Court for allowing the withdrawal of the approval application were not sustainable. The Court disagreed with the notion that proceedings under Section 6(e)(2)(b) and those on reference under Section 4(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act cannot be allowed to continue simultaneously. The Court noted that the scope of proceedings under these two provisions is different, and they can be pursued concurrently. The Supreme Court refrained from expressing an opinion on the reasons given in the Industrial Tribunal's order or on the consequences of allowing the withdrawal of the approval application. The Court also did not offer an opinion on whether the prayer for withdrawal could be declined. In essence, the Court kept all questions open for further consideration.

[Facts] The appeal pertains to a case in which the appellant union claimed to represent workers in a canteen operated by the respondents. The union asserted that even though the workers were effectively employees of the respondents, the respondents treated them differently and engaged contractors to run the canteen. The union filed a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971, alleging unfair labor practices by the respondents. The complaint was dismissed by the industrial court. The appellant union directly filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court against this dismissal. The High Court of Bombay had previously ruled that under the MRTU&PULP Act, the industrial court cannot convert contract labor into direct employees of the company, which influenced the appellant's direct appeal to the Supreme Court.
[Ratio of the decision] The decision states that the provisions of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act (MRTU&PULP Act) can only be enforced by individuals who are confirmed as workmen. If there is a dispute about whether employees are considered employees of the company, this dispute should be resolved first through the appropriate legal process. Only after the workmen status is established can a complaint be filed under the MRTU&PULP Act. In this case, the respondent company denied that the members of the appellant union were its employees, and the industrial court confirmed this by finding that the appellant union members were not employees of the company. As a result, the complaint filed by the appellant union was deemed not maintainable. The court clarified that the appellant or their members have the option to raise the dispute about their employment status in the appropriate legal forum and, upon receiving a declaration confirming their employment, they could then potentially file such a complaint. The court also emphasized that any observations or findings made by the industrial court in the impugned order would not affect the decision made in the appropriate forum regarding the employment status dispute.

[Facts] This case involves two tenants who were renting a property owned jointly by two sisters. The property was later divided through partition proceedings, and the tenants claimed that the owners treated them unfairly and engaged contractors to run a canteen on the premises. The tenants filed a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act (MRTU&PULP Act), alleging unfair labor practices. The industrial court dismissed the complaint, stating that the tenants' workmen status needed to be resolved before filing a complaint under the MRTU&PULP Act. The court emphasized that the dispute about the tenants' employment status should be resolved first through the appropriate legal process before filing such a complaint. The appellant union appealed the decision, but the court upheld the dismissal of the complaint and clarified that the tenants could raise their status dispute in the appropriate forum before filing a complaint under the Act.
[Ratio of the decision] This case involves co-owned property that was divided through partition proceedings. The property had two tenants who continued to hold their tenancies. The tenants agreed to pay rent to both co-owners of the property, and the rent was apportioned in equal shares. One co-owner transferred her share to a partnership firm, and later that share was purchased by some partners of the firm. The co-owners filed suits for eviction against the tenants, and the suits were initially dismissed. Later, due to various legal actions and transfers, the case reached the appellate court. The court emphasized that when one co-owner files a suit for eviction against a tenant, it is assumed that all co-owners consent to it unless proven otherwise. In this case, one co-owner sold her share, and some partners of the tenant firm bought that share. The court ruled that this partial transfer did not result in a merger of the tenancy, and the tenancy rights were not extinguished. The court also found that the decree for eviction should not be available for execution for three months to allow the tenants time to make the necessary deposit. Overall, the court dismissed the appeals filed by the tenants and upheld the eviction decree for one tenant while allowing a grace period for execution and providing instructions on the division of the property.

[Facts] The appellant is contesting a case wherein the second respondent filed a complaint against the appellant and his wife under the Prized Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Prohibition) Act and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The Chief Judicial Magistrate ordered the complaint to be sent to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The appellant challenged this order in revision, which was dismissed by the Sessions Court. The appellant then moved the High Court under Section 482 of the CrPC. The High Court determined that the magistrate was authorized to order an investigation in a private complaint case under Section 156(3) of the CrPC and that such an investigation is necessary in the public interest. The High Court ruled that even though police investigation can commence without a magistrate's order, when a magistrate orders an investigation after taking cognizance of the offense in a complaint, it should be followed. The appellant is now contesting this decision in an appeal.
[Ratio of the decision] The accused challenged the legality of an order for investigation issued by a magistrate in response to a private complaint. The accused contested this order through various legal avenues, including revision before the Sessions Court and invoking the inherent powers of the High Court. However, their efforts were unsuccessful. This appeal arose from those proceedings. The accused were accused of offenses under the Prized Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Prohibition) Act and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. In the course of the proceedings, the issue of a magistrate's power to order investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was raised. Different High Courts had taken differing views on this matter. The appellant in this case contended that a magistrate ordering an investigation under this section must first examine the complainant on oath under Section 200 of the CrPC. The Supreme Court addressed these issues in its decision. It emphasized that there is a distinction between investigation under Chapter XII of the CrPC (dealing with information to the police and their powers to investigate) and the steps a magistrate must take after taking cognizance of an offense in a complaint under Chapter XV (which contains Section 202 and outlines the magistrate's actions in this context). The Court clarified that a magistrate can order investigation under Section 156(3) before taking cognizance of the offense. In such cases, the magistrate is not required to examine the complainant on oath because he is not taking cognizance of any offense at that point. Additionally, the Court ruled that the registration of an FIR (First Information Report) can be directed by the magistrate when ordering investigation under Section 156(3), even if not explicitly stated. The Court also upheld the power of the magistrate to exercise discretion in taking cognizance of a cognizable offense. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that a magistrate's order for investigation under Section 156(3) can be made without examining the complainant on oath or the witnesses present at the time of filing the complaint. The word "may" in Section 190 of the CrPC does not necessarily mean "must," and the magistrate has the discretion to send the complaint to the police for investigation in cases involving cognizable offenses. In summary, the Supreme Court clarified the distinction between the stages of investigation and the magistrate's actions after taking cognizance of an offense under the CrPC. It affirmed the magistrate's power to order investigation under Section 156(3) without examining the complainant on oath and clarified that the magistrate's discretion comes into play in deciding whether to take cognizance of a cognizable offense based on the nature of the complaint.

[Facts] This case involves a motor accident claim brought before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Ludhiana. The claimant, the mother of a deceased teenager, alleged that her son died due to the reckless driving of the second respondent, who was driving a goods vehicle. The Tribunal found that the victim's death resulted from the negligent driving of the second respondent, whose vehicle was insured by the appellant insurance company. The Tribunal accepted the claim and ordered the insurance company to pay compensation of Rs 1,32,000 with interest. The appellant insurance company contested, arguing that as the vehicle was a goods vehicle, they shouldn't be liable for passengers. However, the Tribunal and subsequently the High Court upheld the decision, and the High Court added that if the owner of the vehicle had committed any breach, the insurance company could recover the compensation amount from him.
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the issue revolves around whether an insurance policy for a goods vehicle covers gratuitous passengers. The court examines the impact of a 1994 legislative amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act, which added the phrase "including the owner of the goods or his authorized representative carried in the vehicle." The court considers whether this wording encompasses gratuitous passengers as well. The court rejects the notion that the amendment's wording implies coverage for such passengers. The court emphasizes that the legislative intention was to provide third-party risk coverage and that the changes introduced in the 1988 Act differ from the 1939 Act's provisions. The court holds that the amendment doesn't extend coverage to gratuitous passengers, who were not contemplated when the insurance contract was formed and for whom no premium was paid. The court concludes that the owner of the vehicle, rather than the insurer, is liable to satisfy the awarded compensation to the claimant. The court also clarifies that the insurer can recover the amount from the owner through a proceeding before the executing court, as governed by Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The court's decision takes into account changes in the law and the scope of insurance coverage for different types of passengers in goods vehicles.

[Facts] Residents of Santiniketan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Calcutta High Court, concerned about the defacement of the ambiance and environment around Visva Bharati University. The university's purpose and ideals were being compromised due to the construction of residential and commercial complexes by developers without regard for environmental laws. The PIL particularly focused on proposed constructions in the Khoai area, involving the West Bengal Housing Board and Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. Unauthorised structures on the plot had been mostly removed, with revenue from the project intended for other public projects. The Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA) had undertaken various public benefit works in the area. However, the High Court dismissed the PIL, stating that since the university didn't own the entire 3000 acres of land, no relief could be granted. The court's decision was based on whether the land was specially acquired for the university's purpose.
[Ratio of the decision] The act establishing Visva Bharati University was enacted with the aim of preserving its uniqueness, tradition, and special features as a unitary teaching and residential university. The constitution does not provide for a charter but designates the Union government responsible for institutions of national importance. The act's purpose was to disseminate knowledge, understanding, and free communication of ideas, as envisioned by Rabindranath Tagore when founding the university. The High Court acknowledged that proposed developments by Bengal Ambuja Housing Complex Ltd. would change the landscape but deemed some changes necessary due to population growth. However, the Court stated that Santiniketan should maintain its unique features and upheld the act's objectives. The Act doesn't confer ownership of the entire area upon the university, and development should be sustainable and conform to pollution control laws and ecological preservation. Santiniketan's future planning must respect the act's provisions, emphasizing preservation and reasonable development. The Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA) should distinguish itself from other development authorities, considering the environmental impact and the university's distinct character. The Court recognized the need to balance development and preservation, allowing ongoing construction by Bengal Peerless while directing SSDA to abide by legal provisions and previous observations in future activities.

[Facts] The case involves two appeals filed against a judgment by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in favor of the Coast Guard and the underwriters of a vessel. The vessel, named "Kobe Queen" or "Gloira Kopp," was found loaded with steel products in Indian territorial waters. The crew members, mainly from Ukraine, were arrested, and the vessel was seized due to pending investigations. The crew sought wages from the vessel's sale proceeds, but the Coast Guard opposed, resulting in legal proceedings. The High Court allowed the Coast Guard's appeals, permitting them to handle the vessel, crew, and cargo. Later, the ship was confiscated and auctioned due to various reasons, including unauthorized deviation and entry into Indian waters. The crew argued for wages from the auction proceeds, asserting a maritime lien, which the High Court accepted. The Commissioner of Customs' order proposing confiscation was held not to affect the crew's claim for wages. The crew's rights to wages were upheld, and the government was required to reimburse them for the amount secured by the goods pledged. The judgment praised the assistance provided during the case.
[Ratio of the decision] The decision of the court can be summarized as follows: 1. The court ruled that the vessel violated Indian territorial waters and the provisions of the Customs Act, making it liable for confiscation. There is no question of making any first charge on the vessel, and the crew's legal dues must be considered to prevent further suffering. 2. The court held that the Merchant Shipping Act is applicable to foreign seamen and that crew members can file an application even if a suit is pending. The court disagreed with the contention that the crew's right to wages is extinguished by the ship's confiscation. 3. The court observed that the crew's right to wages is protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India (right to life) and cannot be ignored. The court held that the crew's maritime lien for wages continues even if the ship is confiscated and sold. 4. The court discussed the concept of maritime liens, highlighting that they are recognized in admiralty law and are enforceable through admiralty claims in rem. 5. The court criticized the view that confiscation automatically extinguishes the crew's maritime lien, stating that it only suspends their rights temporarily. The court emphasized the importance of recognizing customary practices in admiralty law. 6. The court disagreed with the division bench's interpretation that the word "absolute" in Section 115(2) of the Customs Act refers to extinguishing all interests and charges, including maritime liens. 7. The court stressed the importance of maritime lien to the crew's right to wages, which is protected under the Merchant Shipping Act and the Constitution. 8. The court held that the crew's right to wages is not limited to the ship's sale but also includes proceeds from the sale of cargo. The court rejected the argument that the crew's lien depends on cargo claims. 9. The court stated that judicial review in environmental adjudications involves protecting life and sustaining nature's orders, and it should generate concern for life and the environment. 10. The court concluded that the crew members are entitled to fair treatment, and the confiscation of the ship should not be treated as an absolute forfeiture of rights. The court criticized the narrow approach taken by the lower court and emphasized the need for a dynamic and constructive approach to social justice.  Overall, the court's decision upheld the crew's right to wages through maritime liens, emphasizing constitutional protection and international maritime law principles. The decision criticized the division bench's interpretation of the Customs Act and emphasized the importance of protecting the rights of workers, especially in the context of maritime law.

[Facts] The respondent in this case sought a modification of the price indicated in an allotment letter issued by the appellants for land acquisition. The appellants acquired land for urban development in Mohali, Punjab, and the respondent claimed co-ownership rights to a portion of the land. The dispute involved several legal proceedings, including a writ petition and appeals. Background facts include the appellants acquiring land for urban development, with the respondent claiming co-ownership rights to a portion of it. A writ petition was filed seeking price modification in an allotment letter, and the high court granted relief, directing the application of a rate prevalent in 1985. The appellant argued that the high court's decision was based on the mistaken assumption that the respondent had been granted relief in an earlier order, when in fact his case was not pressed. The awards for the land acquisition were dated 1975 and 1996, and the respondent had previously agreed to the price calculation. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel argued that there was confusion regarding co-sharer entitlements for the plot and that previous decisions established principles relating to allotments. In summary, the case involves a dispute over land allotment pricing due to co-ownership claims. The respondent's request for a modification in the price indicated in the allotment letter was granted by the high court based on the prevailing rate in 1985, while the appellant contested this decision based on previous proceedings and agreements.
[Ratio of the decision] The case involves an allotment scheme for residential plots to individuals whose land was acquired for urban development. The respondent received an allotment under the scheme, and changes were made to the scheme later on. The key issue was the rate at which the allotment was made. The high court's decision to apply the rate prevalent in 1985 is unsustainable for several reasons. The high court incorrectly assumed that relief had been granted to the respondent in an earlier writ petition, when in fact no relief was claimed for the respondent. The respondent had agreed to the prevalent rates of the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA) in an affidavit accompanying his application for allotment. At the time of allotment in 2001, the rate was Rs 3200 per square yard. Given these facts, the high court's direction to apply the 1985 rate is untenable. The appellant's rate mentioned in the allotment letter from 2001 stands. If the respondent deposits the required amount within three months, the appellant will allot the land and provide possession within two weeks from the payment date, with the applicable amount to be calculated by the appellant.

[Facts] The appeals challenge a Karnataka High Court judgment dated February 15, 2001, concerning Defense Research & Development Organization (DRDO) technical cadre recruitment rules. The appellants, former chargemen grade II in the Ministry of Defence, sought to invalidate Rule 6(4)(a) of the DRDO recruitment rules, claiming it violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Rule 6(4)(a) placed individuals with specific qualifications in a higher grade (category II) and others in a lower grade (category I). The appellants lacked the qualifications mentioned in the rule's schedule, leading to their placement in category I. They argued that this division of chargemen grade II personnel based on qualifications was discriminatory. The court concluded that this categorization did not infringe Article 14.
[Ratio of the decision] The court rejected the appellants' argument that Rule 6(4)(a) violated Article 14 of the Constitution by adversely affecting their promotion prospects. The court emphasized that established legal precedents support the practice of categorization based on educational qualifications. It reiterated that such categorization is permissible under Article 14, and the fact that chargemen grade II with the qualifications mentioned in the rule's schedule were placed in a more favorable category was not a violation of the principle.

[Facts] The appellant was a defendant in a suit concerning a property in West Bengal. The plaintiff claimed ownership of the property based on registered deeds of conveyance. An ex parte decree was passed in favor of the plaintiff, and the appellant did not file a written statement but testified as a witness. The appellant's objection to an application for amending the decree's schedule was rejected by the executing court and upheld by the high court. The appellant argued that the true owners of the property were not parties to the suit and that the ex parte decree would cause irreparable harm. The appellant contended that the impugned order disregarded relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and could be rectified.
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that the mistake in describing the suit property was an accidental error and not intentional, and thus, the plaintiff's application for amendment of the plaint and decree was permissible. The court held that under Section 152 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), clerical or arithmetical mistakes in judgments, decrees, or orders, or errors arising from accidental slips or omissions, could be corrected by the court that passed the decree. However, this correction should not affect the merits of the case, and the power to correct cannot be used to rectify errors anterior to the proceedings before the court. The court emphasized that such corrections must be clear and not raise disputed questions. If the amendment is necessary to correct accidental slips or omissions, it is within the scope of Section 152, but if it goes to the merits of the case or is intentional, other remedies like appeal, revision, or review should be sought. In this case, since the appellant was aware of the issues and participated as a witness, the missing description in the schedule did not warrant interference. The court also ruled that parties not bound by the decree were not entitled to impleadment.

[Facts] The case involves appellants who were appointed as chargeman grade II, and due to a slight difference in marks, they were appointed as supervisor grade A. A government order allowed them to appear in the next examination to qualify as chargeman grade II. Later, the posts of supervisor grade A and chargeman grade II were directed to merge. The central administrative tribunal allowed the appellants' application, directing the authorities to fix their seniority and benefits. The order was partially modified by the Supreme Court, and the central government challenged it. Despite the dismissal of the government's appeal, it did not comply with the order, leading to a contempt petition. The appellants filed an application to prevent promotions ignoring the tribunal's order, and this was modified later. The appellants' seniority position became a bone of contention due to the interpretation of the concept of notional seniority by a full bench of the central administrative tribunal in 1995. The respondents argued that appellants were entitled to promotions and notional seniority at each level based on the interpretation of the tribunal's judgment.
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that appellants who were graded as supervisor grade A should be allowed another chance to take an examination to become chargeman grade II. This policy would have retrospective effect to cover past cases where the authorities had already allowed supervisory apprentices another chance. The court agreed with the Supreme Court's observations and found that the respondent authorities had acted discriminatorily by not allowing the appellants to sit in earlier examinations. The court directed the authorities not to hold the examination and to grant the same benefits to similarly affected respondents. The court clarified that while retrospective promotion might not always come with retrospective seniority, those given notional seniority should not be disadvantaged compared to regularly appointed individuals. The court criticized the denial of benefits to the appellants despite similar cases receiving them, finding this unjustifiable. The judgment entitles the appellants to the benefits as contemplated, and the state cannot treat similarly situated employees differently.

[Facts] The cases involve disputes related to passenger status and insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act. In one category of cases, the question pertains to unauthorized passengers and their entitlement to insurance claims. The correctness of the decision in the Satpal Singh case is questioned. The judgments in these cases examine whether the individuals were authorized passengers, owners of goods being transported, or mere gratuitous passengers. The judgments of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals, as well as the High Courts, vary based on the evidence and circumstances presented. The issue revolves around whether insurance coverage extends to unauthorized or non-fare paying passengers and owners of goods being transported. The Satpal Singh case is cited as a precedent in some cases to determine the scope of insurance coverage for such situations. The cases highlight the complexities and varying interpretations surrounding passenger status, insurance claims, and liability in accidents governed by the Motor Vehicles Act.
[Ratio of the decision] The cases involve the interpretation of insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act, specifically section 147. The cases fall into two categories based on the versions of the Act (1939 and 1988) applicable. The question revolves around whether insurance companies are liable to pay compensation for the death or injury of passengers in goods vehicles. In cases arising under the 1939 Act, the judgments examine the meaning of "goods carriage" and whether carrying passengers in such vehicles is contemplated. The definition of "goods carriage" in the 1939 Act suggests that it's intended solely for the carriage of goods, excluding passenger transportation. Therefore, insurance policies wouldn't be liable for passengers in goods vehicles under this Act. For cases under the 1988 Act, the judgments analyze the changes in the relevant provisions compared to the 1939 Act. Section 147 of the 1988 Act doesn't impose statutory liability on vehicle owners to insure passengers in goods vehicles. The provisos of this section also limit compulsory coverage for passengers in public service vehicles and employees in goods vehicles to the liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act. The context suggests that "any person" in section 147 of the 1988 Act refers to third parties, not passengers in goods vehicles. The judgments emphasize that the Act doesn't require insurance coverage for passengers in goods vehicles. The principle of the 1994 judgment in the Oriental Insurance Co. case is invoked to support the notion that insurance companies aren't liable in such cases. The courts find that owners of goods vehicles need not take out insurance for passengers, unlike passenger-carrying vehicles. The cases differ in their application of the law. In some cases, the courts uphold the insurance company's position, stating that the policy doesn't extend to passengers in goods vehicles. In others, they find in favor of claimants who were traveling as owners of the goods being transported. The judgments also clarify that the absence of insurance coverage for passengers in goods vehicles isn't a violation of the policy and doesn't warrant denying compensation to claimants. Overall, the judgments reflect the complexities of interpreting insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act, taking into account the specific provisions of different versions of the Act and their applicability to various situations involving passengers in goods vehicles.

[Facts] This case involves an appeal challenging the judgment of a single judge of the Orissa High Court. The appellant, Hari Prasad Chhapolia, was convicted for offenses under the Customs Act, 1962, and the Gold Control Act, 1968. After various proceedings and adjournments, it was revealed that the appellant had passed away. An application was filed to substitute the legal heirs of the deceased appellant and to condone the delay in filing the application. The Supreme Court examines the principles governing such situations. The court emphasizes that the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, doesn't directly apply to appeals before the Supreme Court, especially those granted through special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution. Therefore, the provisions of Section 431 of the old code aren't automatically applicable to appeals under Article 136. The court determines that there is no provision for the abatement of such appeals due to the death of the appellant. The court refers to a previous case where it was established that an appeal filed by special leave continues even after the death of the appellant and can be continued by their legal representatives. It is clarified that there's no distinction between appeals that were filed by the appellant or permitted to continue by their legal representatives in terms of their continuity. A previous case is cited where legal representatives sought to continue the appeal after the appellant's death, but the court declined as the claimed interest was deemed too remote and contingent. The court draws a distinction between cases where the interest of legal representatives is direct and contingent, and in the latter case, the court may not permit the continuation of the appeal. In the present case, the court notes that the interest of the legal representatives is contingent as it involves claiming arrears of salary based on the overturning of the conviction. Consequently, the court holds that the legal representatives can't continue the appeal, and the application for substitution and condonation of delay is dismissed.
[Ratio of the decision] In cases where an appeal is against a sentence of fine, it may be continued even after the death of the appellant. However, if the sentence is one of imprisonment, and the accused dies, the appeal would abate since the sentence becomes infructuous and doesn't affect the property of the deceased in the hands of their legal representatives. There's no valid reason for different rules to apply to appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution compared to other appeals, so the widow of the deceased appellant can continue the appeal since the fine sentence directly affects the property. In this case, the widow of the deceased appellant, who has been brought on record as the legal representative, is entitled to continue the appeal since the sentence of fine directly affects the property. The court refers to the principles of Section 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which can be applied in appeals before the Supreme Court. Although a statutory period of 30 days is fixed for such applications, the court notes that the application was filed nearly a year later without an acceptable explanation for the delay. Therefore, the appeal has abated.

[Facts] This case involves a State appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 447 of 1988. The respondent, Kalyan Singh, was acquitted of charges related to the killing of two individuals during a conflict. The prosecution argued that Kalyan Singh fired shots leading to the deaths, while the defense presented an alternative version that implicated others. The trial court convicted Kalyan Singh, but the High Court acquitted him due to several doubts raised, including delayed witness statements, conflicting evidence, non-compliance with legal procedures, and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. The High Court gave Kalyan Singh the benefit of doubt and set aside his conviction and sentence.
[Ratio of the decision] The State appeals against the acquittal in Criminal Appeal No. 1062 of 2003. The High Court had acquitted the respondent, Kalyan Singh, due to certain circumstances creating doubt about the prosecution's case. The State challenges this decision, arguing that the circumstances referred to by the High Court were not significant enough to disprove the clear evidence presented by the prosecution witnesses. The State contends that factors like the delay in recording statements of certain witnesses, discrepancies in reports, and the failure to send the report to the nearest magistrate were relevant and material. The State seeks a review of the High Court's decision based on these points.

[Facts] The appellant challenges an order by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Criminal Petition No. 1737 of 2001. The appellant filed a complaint against respondents, alleging dishonoring of a cheque. The High Court quashed the complaint against the fourth respondent, stating that the complaint was not properly signed by the payee's power of attorney holder. The appellant appealed this decision. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, stating that the complaint was validly filed by the payee's power of attorney holder. The High Court's order was set aside, and the case was directed to proceed as previously ordered by an interim order.
[Ratio of the decision] The crux of the decision is that a complaint signed by an attorney holder is maintainable for offences under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complainant must satisfy the eligibility criterion prescribed by the statute, which in this case requires that the complaint be by the payee or the holder in due course. The court concludes that a proprietary concern (sole proprietorship) can file a complaint in the name of the concern itself, either by the proprietor, by describing the concern as a sole proprietary concern represented by the proprietor, or by the attorney holder under a valid power of attorney. The assumption that a complaint by an attorney holder of a proprietary concern is not valid is incorrect, and such a complaint is maintainable. The court further asserts that there is no irregularity in the procedure of the attorney holder being examined as the complainant during court proceedings.

[Facts] This case involves an appeal against a division bench's order that allowed a letters patent appeal filed by respondents against a single judge's order in a writ petition. The appellant raised the preliminary objection that the appeal was not maintainable. The respondent trust was registered under the Madhya Public Trust Act, 1951. The issue revolved around whether the registrar of public trusts had the authority to review the registration after it had been granted. The division bench held that the single judge's decision was incorrect, remanding the case back to the single bench for proper consideration. The appellant argued that the division bench shouldn't have interfered with the single judge's finding and that the applicable sections of the Act were overlooked. The appellant also contended that all parties affected by the order should have been heard. The division bench's ultimate direction was to remand the case to the single bench for proper consideration, taking into account the ongoing civil suits related to the registration issue.
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that a person can resort to writ jurisdiction when they are unable to file a suit under Subsection (1) of Section 8. The petitioner's absence as a party before the registrar during the inquiry means that the petitioner's claim is not covered by the registration order. If a matter is inadequately dealt with or dismissed without proper consideration, it should be set aside, and the issue should be fully addressed. Injunctions or setting aside orders should be decided in the civil court, not remanded to a single bench. Questions of title or the competency of the settler to establish trust can be resolved in civil suits. Both parties should expedite the suits' resolution, aiming for completion within a year from the order's communication. The division bench's direction in the letters patent appeal was deemed appropriate and valid given the circumstances.

[Facts] In this case, the appellant sought permission to run a co-education school, which was granted initially but challenged by the first respondent who already ran a secondary school. The Bombay High Court set aside the initial permission and directed reconsideration with a hearing for both parties. Subsequently, the permission was canceled and later reconsidered, leading to a legal battle. The High Court canceled the renewed permission. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the appellant to run the school based on regulations and their initial permission. The appellant had been running the school for about eight years, and the Court decided to permit them to continue due to the circumstances, disregarding technical objections by the first respondent.
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant sought permission to run a school, which was granted and later canceled due to legal challenges. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court. The objection to the school's continuation was raised by the first respondent, a rival school, claiming there was no need for another school and that competition might lead to closure of existing schools. The state government stated that more schools were needed in the area and there was no harm in healthy competition. The Court found the objection baseless, considering the area's need for more schools and the positive impact of competition on efficiency and excellence. The appellant's school had been running for nearly eight years without negatively affecting the rival school.

[Facts] The appellant was a witness in a criminal case where he reported an assault and his statement was recorded during the investigation. Subsequently, a complaint was filed accusing the appellant of conspiring in the crime. The judicial magistrate issued process against the appellant and others based on the complaint. The Bombay High Court directed the magistrate to conclude the trial within a stipulated time. The appellant sought protection from self-incrimination but the magistrate denied it. The High Court stated that the appellant was not an accused in the police case and the protection against self-incrimination could not be extended. The case cited an earlier judgment that highlighted the right to protection against self-incrimination. The appellant's request for protection from self-incrimination was denied based on the distinction between his status as a witness and an accused.
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant was involved in a criminal case as a witness where he provided a statement during the investigation. Subsequently, he became an accused in a complaint case related to the same incident. He sought protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution against self-incrimination, claiming that being compelled to testify would violate his rights. The court considered whether his situation warranted such protection. The court noted that Article 20(3) applies to self-incriminating statements relating to charges against an accused. The appellant, not being an accused in the police case, wasn't entitled to blanket protection. However, if a question arose during his testimony that could incriminate him, he could claim protection then. The court emphasized that the appellant's situation didn't warrant granting blanket protection and clarified that his right to refuse answering self-incriminating questions would be upheld during the trial. The court also distinguished this case from a prior ruling involving police interrogation and Article 20(3) protection.

[Facts] The appellant filed a criminal revision in the Supreme Court of India after respondents 2 to 8 were acquitted by the trial court for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appellant, who was the informant in the case, argued that the trial court didn't take adequate measures to secure the attendance of prosecution witnesses, leading to the wrongful acquittal. However, the High Court rejected the revision petition, stating that the trial court had indeed taken reasonable steps to secure witness attendance. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision.
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant filed a criminal appeal (No. 1145 of 2003) in the Supreme Court of India, being dissatisfied with the High Court's decision in the case involving Sukhdeo Jha.

[Facts] Dr. Sadankumar Goel, the husband of the deceased Dr. Asha Goel, filed a criminal writ petition (No. 1930 of 2006) requesting that the authorities take appropriate action under Section 166A of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. The petition raised concerns about the investigation into the murder of Dr. Asha Goel and the lack of proper medical and forensic analysis. Dr. Sadankumar Goel believed that conducting mitochondrial DNA analysis on materials seized by the police during the investigation could establish the guilt of the accused with certainty. The investigating agency acknowledged that the forensic laboratory facilities in India lacked the necessary technology for this analysis. The High Court directed the investigating agency to send the collected materials to a forensic laboratory in Canada for examination, as Dr. Asha Goel was a Canadian citizen of Indian origin. The Court emphasized that the analysis could shed light on the culpability of the accused. The investigation involved a confession by the accused, the seizure of blood-stained clothes, and the involvement of the Canadian coroner in preserving genetic material. The Court's decision aimed to address the limitations of domestic forensic laboratories and ensure a thorough investigation into the case.
[Ratio of the decision] The High Court's decision to direct the investigating agency to send materials for forensic examination to Canada was based on the lack of suitable facilities for mitochondrial DNA analysis in India. The Court noted that this examination could provide crucial evidence for the investigation and help ascertain the culpability of the accused. The Court emphasized that the evidence collection aimed to aid the investigation and not create new evidence. The appellant argued that the prosecution had not made the necessary application or obtained a letter of request from a competent court of law to collect evidence from Canada. The appellant claimed that the laboratory in Canada did not qualify as an authority under Article 12 of the Indian Constitution, and thus the process lacked proper legal foundation. The respondent countered that the appellant's objection was an attempt to avoid materials that could implicate the accused, and the state government acknowledged the unavailability of mitochondrial DNA testing facilities in India. The respondent further argued that the value of the evidence could be tested during the trial and that the accused had no right to be heard at the investigation stage. The Court concluded that the evidentiary value of the materials could be assessed during the trial, and it was not appropriate to intervene at this point. Given that the deceased was a Canadian citizen and the Canadian police were involved in the investigation, the Court declined to interfere and left the matter to be decided by the trial court.

[Facts] The case involves the Indian Institute of Technology (the Institute) and its employees who were initially hired as junior and senior research assistants, and technical assistants. Due to a lack of promotional opportunities, the Institute promoted them to supernumerary posts of laboratory superintendents, but without the benefits enjoyed by academic staff. Some of the employees filed a petition seeking classification as academic staff. Meanwhile, the Institute increased the age of superannuation to 62 years for certain personnel but excluded the laboratory superintendents. The employees then filed another petition to claim the extended superannuation age. The High Court disposed of the two petitions together. It concluded that the first petition had become academic due to time passage and ruled in favor of the employees in the second petition, directing the Institute to apply the extended superannuation age, release necessary grants for salary arrears, and reinstate the employees if needed. The Institute challenged this order, arguing that post classification is the Institute's prerogative under statute 11 and should be based on functions and duties. The Institute contends that the employees' posts were not within the classifications outlined in statute 11. The case revolves around the classification of employee posts and the applicability of the extended age of superannuation, with the Institute contesting the High Court's decision.
[Ratio of the decision] The Supreme Court ruled that the classification of posts within the Indian Institute of Technology (the Institute) is determined by the functions and duties performed by the employees. The Court emphasized that the Institute has the authority to classify posts into academic, technical, or administrative categories through appropriate resolutions. However, since the posts of laboratory superintendents had not been classified under any specified category, and since they were considered as supernumerary posts, the Court ordered that until their classification is determined, the respondents (employees) should retain their original category classification before their promotion to laboratory superintendents. The Court further directed the Institute's Board of Governors to classify the post of laboratory superintendent under the relevant statute, taking into account their duties. The Court allowed the appeals and provided specific directions to clarify the classification of the respondents' posts.
