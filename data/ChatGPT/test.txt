[Facts] The appellant is a company engaged in cigarette manufacturing and sales. The respondent union members work in the canteen of the appellant's factory. A petition was filed seeking the respondents to be treated as employees of the appellant and receive related benefits. The single judge ruled in favor of the respondents, stating that a writ of mandamus would apply when a public duty is imposed on a private management. The division bench affirmed this view, stating that the duty must be a positive obligation to the affected party. The canteen is maintained by the appellant, and the contractor is an agent under its control. The Tribunal ruled that the appellant exercised administrative and financial control over the canteen workers, thus treating them as employees. The High Court dismissed a subsequent writ petition. The case rests on the status of the canteen workers as the appellant's employees, irrespective of a subsequent decision.[Ratio of the decision] The decision discusses the distinction between private and public functions when determining the applicability of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution. The authors of "De Smith, Woolf, and Jowell's Judicial Review of Administrative Action" note that not all activities of private bodies are subject to private law; activities may be governed by public law standards when subject to duties conferred by statute or when a body is performing a function that carries public interest. However, not all decisions made during public functions are subject to judicial review, particularly when other branches of law or contracts govern the dispute. The case under consideration involves a private company engaged in cigarette manufacturing and sale, and it was argued that the company's canteen operation does not constitute a public function. The court found that the operation of a canteen, even if mandatory under certain conditions, is primarily a labor welfare device, unlike cases where a pollution control act imposes an obligation on private companies for the public's benefit. The court concluded that the appellant company was not amenable to writ jurisdiction and that the canteen workers were not its employees for all purposes. While the court disagreed with the high court on the first question, it did not disturb the decision due to the special features of the case. Finally, the court addressed and rejected claims related to hazardous locations for the canteen and a fire incident.
[Facts] The case involves disputes related to the compensation for land acquisition and auction of land owned by M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd (referred to as "the company"). The company had multiple business units, and due to financial difficulties, a receiver was appointed by the District Collector. The land was later acquired by the state, and compensation was awarded to the company. The company challenged the compensation amount and receiver's appointment through writ petitions. The High Court ordered compensation payment based on a compromise between the state and the company. The state and the company both challenged this decision. The company also challenged an auction of its land, which was canceled by the High Court. The auction purchasers requested a refund, leading to a series of legal actions. The issues in various appeals include compensation, the validity of the auction, and the refund of auction amounts. The judgment of the High Court and related orders are under challenge by both the state and the company in these appeals.[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the case where a company had financial difficulties and a receiver was appointed by the District Collector. The company's sugar mill was later acquired by the state, and loans were provided by the state to facilitate its operations. The High Court issued an order directing compensation payments based on a compromise between the state and the company. However, the High Court failed to address the issue of remaining dues and liabilities of the company. The court found that the High Court wrongly declared certain orders as illegal. In another case, auctioned land was cancelled by the High Court, and the auction purchasers requested a refund. The court ruled that equitable grounds warranted interest on the refunded amount, given that the auction purchasers had deposited the full amount and the title had been transferred to them. The state was directed to pay interest at a rate of 6% on the refund amount from the dates of the High Court's orders.
[Facts] The manufacturer of the drug "Barlagan Ketone" reported its price to the central government in 1971. Following the Drugs Prices Control Order of 1979, which aimed to fix maximum prices for essential and non-essential bulk drugs, the manufacturer applied for a price of Rs 8,500 per kg. The central government issued notifications to fix maximum prices for various bulk drugs, including Barlagan Ketone, but these notifications were challenged and quashed by the Delhi High Court due to a lack of adherence to principles of natural justice. The High Court also quashed notifications fixing retail prices for drug formulations, which depend on bulk drug prices. The manufacturers had filed review petitions under the 1979 Order, but since the notifications were quashed, the review petitions also became irrelevant. The Union of India appealed against the High Court's judgment, presenting its case against the judgment, while the manufacturers were represented by their counsel.[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving allegations of exploitation in the pharmaceutical market and high pricing by manufacturers of bulk drugs. The court distinguishes between legislative and non-legislative activities, emphasizing that price fixation is generally a legislative activity. The court asserts that price fixation aims to protect consumers and ensure fair prices for essential commodities. It also clarifies that fairness doesn't require giving manufacturers an opportunity in the price fixation process, as the primary focus is on consumers' interests. The passage highlights legal distinctions and references previous cases to support its arguments. Additionally, it mentions the government's acceptance of recommendations from the Hathi Committee to rationalize drug prices based on the community's needs and welfare. The committee proposed various principles for introducing selectivity in price control for formulations. They discussed factors like the size of production units, selection of items, and controlling prices for market leaders. The committee also debated the exemption of certain units from price control based on turnover or annual sales. They suggested that the ceiling price should consider production costs and a reasonable return for market leaders. Additionally, the committee explored options for identifying important product groups and leading producers for price regulation. The text also discusses the distinction between essential bulk drugs and the price control measures associated with them. It delves into the nature of the review process and the consideration of factors such as production costs and returns on net worth. The text emphasizes the legislative nature of price fixation and the government's role in securing fair prices for consumers. It argues that the focus should be on the interests of the consumer public rather than manufacturers. Furthermore, the text addresses the delay in the review applications and suggests that the government should expeditiously process these applications to prevent prices from becoming outdated. It also touches on the aspect of interim court orders, stating that they should prioritize public interest and not hinder the implementation of price notifications. The text concludes by discussing the circumstances around filing appeals and the delay in doing so. It highlights the need to balance the interests of various parties and the importance of considering public interest in these matters.
[Facts] The accused, Pathan Hussain Basha, was married to Pathan Haseena Begum, now deceased, in an arranged marriage. A dowry of Rs 25,000 was promised, of which Rs 15,000 was paid initially, and the remaining Rs 10,000 was to be paid later. Due to non-payment, the accused and his family harassed and subjected the deceased to cruelty. On February 15, 2003, she committed suicide by hanging herself in the accused's house. The parents of the deceased found her hanging, untied her, and took her to the hospital, but she was declared dead. The accused were arrested, faced trial, and were convicted for offenses under IPC Sections 498A and 304B. They were sentenced to imprisonment and fines. The judgment was challenged in the High Court, leading to the current appeals.[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the evidence presented by the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused in relation to charges under Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC. The complainant, the father of the deceased, testified that after an initially harmonious period, the accused began demanding dowry and mistreating his daughter. The prosecution established that the deceased died by hanging and that she had informed her family about the harassment. The court clarified the meaning of terms like "dowry death," "soon before her death," and "in connection with any demand for dowry." It emphasized that a reasonable time gap between cruelty and death is essential, and that a proximate link must exist between the cruelty, dowry demand, and death. The court discussed the concept of deeming fiction in criminal law, indicating that once the basic ingredients of the offense are proven, a presumption arises that the accused caused the death. The onus shifts to the accused to disprove this presumption. In this case, the prosecution presented strong evidence of the accused's guilt. The court recognized that while the guilt of the accused was established, some leniency might be warranted in sentencing due to their circumstances, including their age and time already spent in jail. Therefore, the court decided to uphold the guilty verdict but reduce the sentences for the appellants. The court also noted that one of the accused had been acquitted by the high court and that the state did not challenge this acquittal.
[Facts] This appeal concerns a property dispute involving various parties. Dwarka Nath Ghose owned properties and dedicated them to a family idol through a will. His son Rajendra confirmed this dedication and made his own will, appointing his brother Jogendra as executor. Disputes arose among Dwarka Nath's descendants, leading to a consent decree in 1910. Premises were allocated to different branches of the family. Jogendra died in 1911, and further complications arose, including mortgages and settlements. Eventually, the premises were sold in 1936 to the appellants. The family idol, through its next friend, filed a suit in 1948 for ownership and possession of the premises. Arguments revolved around dedication, adverse possession, and validity of previous dealings. The High Court ruled against the idol's claim, prompting this appeal. Cross objections were filed but were later withdrawn. The main appeal is being heard by the Supreme Court.[Ratio of the decision] The main points of the court's decision are as follows: 1. The dispute centers around premises no. 41 Grey Street. The first contention by the appellants is not valid based on the language of Dwarka Nath's will. The will explicitly dedicates the property to the deity and restricts the rights of any heirs or representatives to the property. 2. The second contention regarding adverse possession by Nagendra is not upheld. Nagendra was a minor when a settlement was reached in 1910, and he was allowed to join as a sevayat upon reaching majority. There is a clear finding that Nagendra acted as a shebait (caretaker) of the deity, and his possession of the property was on behalf of the idol, rendering his possession non-adverse. In summary, the court upholds the dedication of the property to the deity and dismisses the argument of adverse possession by Nagendra due to his role as a shebait.
[Facts] The case involves twelve accused individuals who were tried for various offenses, including murder, attempted murder, and terrorism charges under TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act) in Pune. Six of the accused were acquitted, while five appellants were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment along with fines for various charges. The incident began with a dispute at a video parlour, which escalated into a violent attack near a hotel and a math. The victims were assaulted with swords, satturs, and sticks. The accused were identified by several witnesses, and medical examinations confirmed injuries on the victims. The trial court acquitted some accused due to lack of identification but convicted the appellants based on strong evidence and testimony.[Ratio of the decision] The appellants have appealed their convictions and sentences under Section 19 of TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act) after being found guilty in a case where a minor altercation escalated into the death of an individual and injuries to others. The incident involved an attack by the accused, armed with weapons, on the victims. The death of the victim and the injuries to others were established through medical evidence. The evidence from various witnesses and victims linked some of the appellants (a 1, a 5, a 8, a 9, and a 11) to the assault beyond a reasonable doubt. However, doubts were raised about the involvement of a 10 due to inconsistencies in the testimonies. The court found that the charge under Section 3 of TADA was not established based on the facts of the case, as there was no evidence to show that the attack was intended to strike terror within a particular community. Therefore, the acquittal of a 10 was upheld, while the convictions and sentences of the other appellants for different offenses were upheld. The court also emphasized that appeals against TADA judgments must go directly to the Supreme Court as per the statute, and it's not within the court's authority to transfer an appeal to a high court after making findings on the merits of the case.
[Facts] This case involves the interpretation of Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The first respondent is the registered proprietor of the "Field Marshal" trademark for diesel engines. M/s. Jain Industries got the same trademark registered for various other products. The appellant started manufacturing centrifugal pumps under the "Field Marshal" mark. Legal disputes arose regarding the use of the trademark by the appellant. The first respondent filed a suit alleging infringement and sought an injunction. During these proceedings, M/s. Jain Industries assigned the trademark and its goodwill to the appellant. The first respondent filed an application for rectification, claiming that the appellant hadn't used the trademark for centrifugal pumps for more than five years, so it should be removed from the register. The appellant, however, obtained a certificate of registration for the trademark in question. A series of legal actions followed, including rectification applications and a writ petition. The Intellectual Property Appellate Board dismissed the rectification application, while the High Court directed the board to adjudicate the dispute on its merits. The High Court's decision is being challenged in this appeal. The central issues revolve around the use of the trademark, the assignment of the trademark to the appellant, and whether the rectification application was valid. The arguments made in both the Board and the High Court are highlighted, including the differing opinions on the period for which the trademark's non-use should be counted.[Ratio of the decision] The key issue in this case is the maintainability of an application under Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act. The interpretation of the phrase "for the time being" in this provision is crucial. Two possible interpretations are discussed: 1) that the words signify non-use of the trade mark for five years by the current owner, and 2) that the mark hasn't been used for five years by either the current owner or their predecessor. Another interpretation is presented by the appellant's counsel, suggesting that "proprietor" in this context may mean someone who acquired the trade mark rights through long use, not just a registered proprietor. The court examines the purpose of the Act, highlighting that registration of a trade mark confers valuable rights, including exclusive use in connection with registered goods. Non-use of a registered trade mark for an extended period leads to consequences outlined in Section 46(1)(b), including potential removal from the register. However, such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved. The court considers that the removal of a trade mark from the register under Section 46(1)(b) is a serious step and must satisfy certain conditions. While trafficking in trade marks should be discouraged, proving speculative assignment requires a strong case. The court emphasizes that non-use by a previous proprietor shouldn't be attributed to the present registered owner. The court delves into the legislative intent, noting that changes in ownership shouldn't provide an opportunity to circumvent the Act's objectives. The court concludes that the interpretation of Section 46(1)(b) must be strict, given that it takes away rights. The Act's intention is not to create a "sunset law" but to determine the validity of trade mark rights on a case-by-case basis. The court highlights that assignment of a trade mark under the Act conveys the same rights as the assignor had at the time of assignment. The court also addresses criticisms of certain interpretations and underscores the need for a valid assignment under the Act. In essence, the court's decision centers on the importance of ensuring a legitimate application of the law, preventing circumvention of the Act's provisions through speculative assignments, and upholding the rights of registered trade mark owners. The court emphasizes the requirement for careful interpretation and application of the statutory provisions.[Facts] The case involves an appeal by the State of Manipur against a judgment and order passed by the Guwahati High Court. The case centers around appointments made in the Revenue Department of Manipur by the Revenue Commissioner, Mr. A.J. Tayeng. The state had not established recruitment rules for these appointments. Mr. Tayeng allegedly made temporary appointments without the state's knowledge, leading to confusion about the validity of the appointments. Appointments were made for various positions on different dates in 1997. Mr. Tayeng denied making these appointments in a note dated January 12, 1998. An inquiry was conducted to determine the issuing authority, during which Mr. Tayeng denied any knowledge of the appointments. The state later canceled the appointments and issued a corrigendum. Mr. Tayeng retired on February 28, 1998. Despite initially denying involvement in the appointments, he later affirmed in an affidavit that he had indeed issued appointment orders. However, he claimed not to have access to the relevant files after retirement. The respondents (individuals appointed) approached Mr. Tayeng after his retirement, and he supported their case by confirming his signature on the appointment orders. He stated that the appointment orders appeared to comply with formalities. In a series of legal proceedings, the writ appeals filed by the State of Manipur were dismissed by the High Court. The case essentially revolves around the validity of appointments made by Mr. Tayeng and the subsequent confusion and disputes over these appointments.[Ratio of the decision] The respondents in the case filed writ petitions before the High Court challenging the cancellation of their appointments. The court examined the matter in light of constitutional principles outlined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Indian Constitution. The court acknowledged that while the State of Manipur might not have established recruitment rules, this didn't exempt them from adhering to constitutional duties and just exceptions when making appointments. The Court assumed that the State had not framed recruitment rules in accordance with Article 309 of the Constitution. However, this did not allow the Revenue Commissioner to make appointments that violated Articles 14 and 16. The appointments of the respondents were cancelled because they were deemed to be made without the knowledge of the Revenue Department and were considered invalid. The Court reasoned that if the appointment letters were fake documents, the State had no obligation to pay salaries based on them. Actions that violate the constitutional and legal framework cannot be considered binding on the State. The respondents were obligated to establish the existence of a legal right in their favor to warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus. However, they failed to prove that the appointments followed the constitutional mandate of Articles 14 and 16. The Court also highlighted that the Commissioner of Revenue was not the appointing authority and did not possess the power to issue appointment letters. The respondents were not validly appointed, and the question of their consideration for promotion or recruitment did not arise. The Court concluded that the principles of natural justice were not applicable in this case due to the admitted facts, and there was no arbitrariness on the part of the State in cancelling the appointments.[Facts] The appellant in this case was detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). He was the managing director of a company involved in exporting alloy steel products. Allegedly, he misdeclared goods and values, using fake bills to export non-alloy steel as alloy steel in order to receive export incentives. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) investigated and found incriminating documents. The appellant was detained based on these allegations. The appellant's writ petition for habeas corpus was dismissed by the High Court. Key dates and events included: 1. Letters from DRI indicating exoneration for earlier years and non-scrutiny of transactions after a specific date. 2.Unfreezing of the appellant's bank accounts. 3. Release of goods, documents, and contempt notice by civil courts. 4. The detention order was passed based on the conclusion that the appellant engaged in prejudicial activities involving smuggling. The question revolved around whether material documents were placed before the detaining authority. The significance of the documents lay in whether they enabled the appellant to make a meaningful representation against the detention order, as his right to do so was both constitutional and statutory. In paragraph 36 of the detention order, the detaining authority expressed satisfaction with the need for detention to prevent future smuggling activities. The crux was whether the withheld documents were material for the appellant's effective representation, as their non-supply could render the detention order invalid.[Ratio of the decision] In this legal case, the appellant's detention is being discussed. Several issues have been raised, including the failure to present important documents to the authority responsible for the detention, the delay in issuing the detention order, and doubts about the authority's proper consideration of the case. The appellant was eventually released from custody, and the court is examining the reasons for the delay. Despite some explanation for the delay, the court questions why the detention order took four months to be issued after the proposal for detention was made. The court notes that certain transactions were not under scrutiny by the authorities, as confirmed by their letters. The court also mentions that relevant documents, including statements of the appellant and another individual, were not provided to the detaining authority. The court emphasizes the necessity of supplying all relevant documents for the appellant's right to make an effective representation. The court concludes that the delay and lack of proper consideration raise concerns about the validity of the detention order and suggests that the case should be viewed from a different perspective. While the appellant's period of detention is over, the court considers the impact on the appellant's civil liabilities and reputation, and indicates that the order of detention may need to be quashed to address these issues.[Facts] This is an appeal against a judgment by the Bombay High Court affirming the conviction of the appellants under Section 304 B read with Section 34 IPC. The case involves the death of Bhimabai, who was married to appellant no. 1, and allegedly suffered harassment from the appellants related to dowry demands. Initially, Bhimabai was treated well, but later, the appellants started asking for money from her parents. Bhimabai complained about harassment and beatings by her husband and mother-in-law. On September 15, 1991, she was found dead, with evidence of poison consumption. The prosecution argues she committed suicide due to harassment for dowry. Witnesses provide accounts of the ill-treatment Bhimabai faced. The trial involves issues of dowry demand, harassment, and the cause of Bhimabai's death. Post-mortem results suggest insecticide poisoning. The evidence centers on claims of domestic trouble and financial demands leading to Bhimabai's death.[Ratio of the decision] The main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money, harassment, and beating towards Bhimabai are her parents, specifically PW1 Tukaram and PW5 Sumanbai. PW1 testified that his daughter complained of harassment by the appellants on various visits, and appellant no. 1 had asked Bhimabai to bring money for expenses and manure. PW5 Sumanbai stated that Bhimabai faced ill treatment due to a "domestic cause" involving a demand for money. Notably, her statement under Section 161 Cr. P.C., recorded shortly after the incident, did not mention the money demand as the cause of ill treatment. The evidence suggests that the police didn't favor the accused when recording her statement. Considering the legal definition of "dowry" and its strict interpretation, a demand for money due to financial difficulties or domestic expenses cannot be considered a demand for dowry. The evidence doesn't establish the essential element of dowry demand as defined in the Dowry Prohibition Act. Consequently, the appellants' conviction under Section 304B IPC cannot be upheld. The appellants were also charged under Sections 498A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but were acquitted, and these acquittals are final. Therefore, the Court refrains from discussing their potential guilt under these charges in this appeal, focusing solely on the conviction under Section 304B IPC.[Facts] This appeal is based on the judgment and order dated 01-07-2002 passed by the Bombay High Court at Goa. The appellant was convicted under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to life imprisonment. This came after the trial court's order of acquittal was set aside. The incident occurred on 19-04-1988, where the appellant, along with other accused individuals and two juvenile offenders, allegedly formed an unlawful assembly. They stabbed one Rauji Dulba Sawant, leading to his death, and assaulted other family members. The prosecution's case was that a heated exchange occurred during a religious ceremony, and this escalated into an assault involving the accused. The appellant was alleged to have used a knife in the attack. The trial court acquitted all accused, but the state appealed against accused nos. 1 to 3. The appellant, being aggrieved by his conviction, filed this appeal. In summary, the case revolves around the appellant's alleged involvement in an assault that resulted in Rauji Dulba Sawant's death and the assault of other family members, leading to his conviction and life imprisonment.[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court reviews the facts to better understand the arguments presented by both parties. The appellant was convicted under section 302 of the IPC. The dispute started over an electricity connection in the house. The incident began in a hall where there was some light, and then a lamp was brought by accused no. 3 to the hall, adding to the available light. There was also a street light outside the house that illuminated the area. The appellant and others became annoyed over the light being switched on and off, leading to a scuffle. During this, accused no. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased suffered fatal stab injuries inflicted by the appellant. The court addresses several contentions raised by the appellant's counsel. It discusses the delay in lodging the FIR, concluding that given the cryptic information received and the darkness at the scene of the incident, the FIR's timing was justified. The court also addresses the availability of light, noting that street lights and lamps provided sufficient illumination for the witnesses, who were family members and natural witnesses. The court further examines the medical evidence, pointing out that although there were minor discrepancies between the ocular evidence and the postmortem report, the cause of death was established as a stab injury caused by the appellant. The court emphasizes that minor discrepancies in the testimony of eyewitnesses are immaterial and cannot undermine their credibility. Finally, the court analyzes whether the case falls under section 302 or 304 Part II of the IPC. It concludes that the circumstances suggest a scuffle, provocation, and no clear intention to cause death. Therefore, the court views the case as falling under section 304 Part II of the IPC, which deals with culpable homicide not amounting to murder.[Facts] In suit number 493 of 1986, filed in the Bombay City Civil Court by Vicco Laboratories against defendants 1 to 4, the appellant claimed exclusive rights to the title and content of the TV serial "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi." Vicco Laboratories, a manufacturer of Ayurvedic pharmaceutical products, alleged that they owned the title and episodes of the serial and sought a declaration and injunction against the defendants from using their material. The defendants were an advertising agency (1st respondent) and its director/partner (2nd respondent), who were involved in producing the serial. The court examined the ownership of the serial, the role of the parties, and copyright issues. Vicco Laboratories argued that they owned the serial since they had financed it and made payments to the defendants for production. They contended that the defendants were acting as their agents and therefore the serial belonged to them. The defendants, on the other hand, claimed that they were the producers of the serial and that the petitioners (Vicco Laboratories) were sponsors. The court analyzed various pieces of evidence, including contracts, bills, and correspondence. The trial court concluded that the petitioners failed to prove that the defendants produced the serial as their agents or that they owned the copyright. The trial court rejected the argument that the petitioners were the sponsors and producers simultaneously. The court found that the petitioners' involvement in the serial came after substantial work had already been done, and they had agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes while the defendants committed to producing 52 episodes. The court also considered Section 17 of the Copyright Act, which deals with ownership of copyright. The court found that the requirements of this section were not met by the petitioners, and thus they couldn't claim ownership based on copyright. Both the trial court and the high court upheld the findings of the trial court, agreeing that the petitioners failed to establish their claims and dismissed the appeal. In summary, the case revolved around the ownership of a TV serial "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi." The court ruled that the petitioners did not prove their ownership claims, whether based on agency, sponsorship, or copyright, and therefore their appeal was dismissed.[Ratio of the decision] The decision's core principle lies in the understanding that copyright isn't attached to mere ideas but rather to the actual work produced. The crucial point is that the defendant (respondent no. 2) not only conceived the idea of the TV serial "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi" but had already begun working on it before sharing it with Doordarshan for approval. This implies that there was no communication of the idea; the defendant was already taking substantial steps before any exchange took place. In this case brought under Article 136 of the Constitution, the arguments presented before the high court were reiterated. Particularly, the effect of Section 17 of the Copyright Act and whether the correspondence demonstrated ownership and copyright entitlement to the TV program "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi." Upon careful consideration, the court was unsatisfied that the petitioners had presented a case worthy of this court's consideration. The case relies heavily on the assessment of evidence and doesn't involve questions of great constitutional importance. The findings from the trial court and the appellate court emphasized: 1. Respondents (defendants) didn't undertake the production of the serial at the request of the petitioners (appellants). The petitioners weren't familiar with the serial's format when concrete steps had already been taken by the defendants. 2. The petitioners agreed to sponsor 26 episodes, while the defendants committed to producing 52 episodes, a fact confirmed in correspondence to Doordarshan. 3. The titles of episodes clearly showed respondent no. 2 as the producer, with the petitioners only being sponsors. 4. The lower courts found that a bill dated March 19, 1984, was backdated, raised by the defendants in July 1984 to aid the petitioners' tax concessions. 5. Doordarshan recognized respondents as producers and the petitioners as sponsors in their statement. 6. Testimony indicated that the defendants dealt with Doordarshan, while petitioners' dealings were with the defendants. 7. Video rights were assigned by the defendants, further negating their role as agents of the petitioners. 8. Letters didn't transfer rights to the petitioners; there was no consideration paid, and the defendants' letters were prompted by the petitioners' interaction with another party. In conclusion, the courts found that respondents weren't agents of the petitioners, and the amount paid wasn't for production costs but fixed sponsorship fees. The courts below correctly analyzed the situation. As for the claim based on Section 17 of the Copyright Act, the respondents didn't create the serial as agents for the petitioners or at their instance, and thus, the issue of copyright ownership under Section 17(b) and (c) doesn't apply.
[Facts] The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has appealed against a judgment dated March 26, 2004, by the Delhi High Court. The High Court granted probation under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, to the second respondent, Gurcharan Singh, but upheld the conviction. The case stems from unauthorized construction found on the first floor of a property, leading to legal action under sections 332 and 461 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The designated municipal court found the accused guilty, prompting an appeal to the Sessions Court and then a criminal revision petition before the High Court. Displeased with the High Court's decision, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. The Additional Sessions Judge also upheld the conviction and the sentence passed by the trial court.[Ratio of the decision] The court reviewed the case's documents and heard arguments from the involved parties. Two questions of law were raised: 1) Whether the High Court correctly extended the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, without seeking a conduct report on the accused, and 2) Whether the High Court's decision was correct considering the respondent's previous conviction. The appellant argued that they were not given the opportunity to provide relevant information regarding the respondent's previous conviction, and that the High Court did not consider this conviction. The court found that the respondent had withheld information about a previous conviction, which amounted to playing fraud on the court. This behavior disentitled the respondent from receiving any relief, and he was directed to pay a cost of Rs 10,000 to the appellant. The court emphasized that when exercising discretion under the Probation of Offenders Act, the circumstances of the case, nature of the offense, and character of the offender must be considered. The High Court failed to call for a report on the respondent's conduct, despite him being a previous convict. As a result, the High Court's judgment was set aside, and the case was remitted for fresh consideration in accordance with the law.[Facts] The case involves an appeal against the Madras High Court's decision to acquit the accused, who was originally convicted under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by a lower court. The accused was convicted for the murder of a Sri Lankan student named Mayurani, whose body was found in a house where both the accused and the victim were residing. The prosecution's case rested on circumstantial evidence, including confessional statements by the accused leading to the recovery of various incriminating items. The trial court found the accused guilty based on these circumstances, but the High Court acquitted him, stating that the highlighted circumstances were insufficient to establish his guilt. The appellant argued that the High Court overlooked the established chain of circumstances supporting the prosecution's case. It was noted that the initial investigating officer (PW 40) had made efforts to falsely implicate other individuals, including the victim's family members, and even initiated a departmental proceeding based on fabricated documents. The reliability of PW 40's evidence was questioned due to these actions. The summary highlights the background, circumstances, evidence, and the differing perspectives of the appellant and the respondent (accused) regarding the trial and appeal process.[Ratio of the decision] The decision emphasizes the principles of evaluating circumstantial evidence in a criminal case. The court highlights that for a case based on circumstantial evidence, the incriminating facts and circumstances must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person. The court refers to various precedents and outlines the following key aspects: 1. The facts forming the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proven and connected to the fact sought to be inferred. 2. The burden of proof lies with the party asserting the existence of a fact that implies legal accountability. 3. The best available evidence must be presented. 4. Inference of guilt must be based on inculpatory facts that are incompatible with the accused's innocence and cannot be explained by any reasonable alternative hypothesis. 5. If there's any reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt, they must be acquitted. The court further clarifies the requirements of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, which pertains to confessional statements leading to the discovery of facts. The court underscores that the fact discovered must be relevant to the issue and connected with the crime, and the discovery must result from information given by the accused. The court also underscores the importance of voluntariness in such confessions. In the present case, the court assesses various aspects of the prosecution's case, including the recovery of incriminating materials and the reliability of confessional statements. Doubts about the voluntariness of confessions, the reliability of witnesses, and the inconsistency of evidence are pointed out. The court concludes that the High Court's judgment acquitting the accused based on these considerations is valid and does not warrant interference. The summary focuses on the court's detailed analysis of the circumstantial evidence presented in the case and its subsequent endorsement of the High Court's decision to acquit the accused.[Facts] This case involves three appeals against an order from the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), which ordered the removal of the "Infosys" trademark from the trade register. The appellant, Infosys Technologies Limited, had registered the mark for computer-related goods and services. Legal disputes arose when the first respondent, Jupiter Infosys Limited, also used the term "Infosys" in its business. Infosys Technologies Limited filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court in 1992, seeking to prevent Jupiter Infosys Limited from using the term. Multiple legal actions followed, including an interim restraint order and a writ petition. Meanwhile, the appellant also filed a suit for infringement and passing off in the Delhi High Court. Jupiter Infosys Limited filed applications before the Madras High Court under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958 (1958 Act) for removal and rectification of registered trademarks. These applications were transferred to the IPAB under the Trade Marks Act 1999 (1999 Act). The IPAB considered various issues, including the use of the mark, intention to use, service mark status, non-use, protection under the law, distinctiveness, and fraud. The IPAB ruled that the trademarks were not used by the appellant for over five years and that the appellant had not engaged in manufacturing or trading of the relevant goods. The case involves complex legal proceedings and multiple name changes by the companies. Both parties' arguments were presented to the court. The first respondent had filed a counter affidavit without specific jurisdiction objections. The appeals contest the IPAB's decision to remove the trademarks from the register.[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court considered the question of whether the first respondent, Jupiter Infosys Limited, was an "aggrieved person" with the standing to apply for the removal and rectification of the "Infosys" trademark registered by the appellant, Infosys Technologies Limited. The court determined that to be considered an "aggrieved person," the applicant's interest must be affected in some practical way, and there must be a likelihood of injury or damage if the trademark remains on the register. The court explained that different sections of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958 have distinct connotations for the term "aggrieved person." Sections 46 and 56 both require the applicant to be "aggrieved" to apply for removal or rectification of a trademark. However, the interpretation of "aggrieved person" differs between these sections. The court established that the applicant must not only be an "aggrieved person" when making the application but must continue to be aggrieved until the application is finally decided. If the applicant's grievance no longer exists due to their own actions, waiver, loss of interest, or any other reason, there might not be sufficient justification for rectification. In light of these considerations, the court concluded that the applications made by Jupiter Infosys Limited for rectification and removal of the trademarks should be reconsidered by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) in accordance with the law. The court refrained from delving into the merits of the diverse arguments presented and left it to the parties to present their contentions before the IPAB.[Facts] This appeal arises from a judgment and order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated April 15, 1986. The case revolves around the acquisition of property by the government in Hyderabad, contested by various parties, particularly Abdul Khader. In 1948, the ruler of Mukkalla state, Sail Nawaz Jung, settled some properties in favor of his son Sultan Awaz and grandson Galib Bin Awaz. The property was requisitioned by the government in 1963. Abdul Khader, claiming to be a tenant, sought compensation for the acquisition. The dispute centered around Abdul Khader's status as a protected tenant under the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 1950. Over the years, various authorities issued conflicting orders regarding Abdul Khader's protected tenant status. The issue went to an arbitrator, who eventually ruled in Abdul Khader's favor. The case went through multiple legal proceedings, including a writ petition, statutory appeals, and additional evidence being introduced. The dispute also involved questions about the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the interpretation of relevant legal provisions. At one point, the Supreme Court granted special leave for the high court to determine certain jurisdictional questions. Various legal points and evidence were discussed, including historical documents, prior orders, and the Andhra Pradesh Act. Ultimately, the high court ruled that Abdul Khader was indeed a protected tenant and entitled to compensation for the acquired property. The court referenced historical documents, legal provisions, and prior orders to support its decision. This appeal challenges the high court's judgment.[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue is whether the high court was correct in upholding the arbitrator's award in favor of Abdul Khader, entitling him to 60% of the compensation for the acquired land. The central act pertains to requisitioning and acquiring immovable property for union purposes. The appeal focuses on Abdul Khader's rights as a protected tenant under the Andhra Pradesh Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act 1950. The appellants argue that since there was no finding by the revenue officer that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant, the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction in deciding his protected tenancy status. However, the court disagrees, stating that the central act mandates compensation to individuals with an interest in the acquired land. The determination of who holds interest is not solely based on revenue authorities' decisions and can be subject to examination by other courts. Section 102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act specifies that the Act does not apply after land is acquired. Hence, it is argued that Section 99 of the Andhra Pradesh Act, which deems the tahsildar's determination final, does not apply to compensation cases. The high court and the arbitrator had every right to consider the validity of Abdul Khader's protected tenant status, considering the circumstances, entries, and subsequent deletions. The court affirms that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine Abdul Khader's compensation based on his interests in the property. This was consistent with previous court orders that left the decision of his protected tenancy status open for determination. The court finds overwhelming evidence to support Abdul Khader's protected tenant status and upholds the high court's decision to grant him 60% of the compensation. In conclusion, the court emphasizes that if the law allows a flower picker to receive a significant portion of compensation while the owners receive less, then that is the outcome dictated by the law.[Facts] In the case, a series of orders and directions were issued by the court regarding admissions to educational institutions for different academic sessions. The case involved various categories of institutions, including unaided minority educational institutions, minority institutions receiving state aid, and others. Initially, an interim order was issued allowing 50% of seats in educational institutions to be filled by candidates selected by state government agencies based on competitive exams, with the other 50% being filled based on merit among candidates from religious or linguistic minorities. A constitution bench categorized various writ petitions challenging these orders into different groups based on the nature of the institutions and the issues involved. The court issued specific directions for each category of institutions. For instance, it clarified that whether an institution was a minority educational institution would be verified by the government, and the 50-50 division between government-selected and institution-selected candidates would apply if they were found to be minority institutions. The court also permitted private professional colleges to admit a limited number of non-resident Indian (NRI) and foreign students based on merit for a particular academic year. The court stated that this was a one-time provision for that year. In the state of Kerala, the court observed that the system for minority educational institutions was different, as the fees collected by private engineering colleges were entirely given to the government, which covered the expenses of running the colleges. The admissions for these institutions were directed to be made according to the terms of agreements with the government of Kerala. For the next academic session, the court directed that admissions in institutions claimed to be minority educational institutions would follow the previously given directions, with some exceptions for institutions governed by agreements with state governments. Additionally, the case involved contempt petitions related to seniority issues among promotees and direct recruits in the government service, stemming from previous cases, including K.C. Joshi v. State of Uttar Pradesh. The court issued directions for the disposal of the seniority-related matters based on representations from the concerned parties. Overall, the case involved a complex series of orders and directions addressing admissions and seniority issues in educational institutions and government service.[Ratio of the decision] In this case concerning admissions to professional courses in various educational institutions claiming minority status, the court reframed questions for consideration. The court acknowledged the importance of clarifying the terms "minority" and "minority educational institution." The case involved several categories of institutions, each with its unique situation. An interim order was issued for the upcoming academic session, assuming that the petitioners were minority institutions. The order directed that admissions be made on the basis of merit, and separate directions were given for institutions referred to in specific writ petitions. Institutions in Kerala that were governed by agreements with the government were required to follow those agreements for admissions. The court addressed non-resident Indian (NRI) and foreign student admissions, limiting their intake to 5% of the total. The management of the institution was allowed to judge the merit of candidates. The case also involved contempt petitions related to seniority issues in government service, specifically for assistant conservators in the forest department. The court directed the determination of inter se seniority between direct recruits and promotees based on established rules. The court emphasized that the seniority should be determined based on the quota system and available vacancies, and the seniority list should be used to fill substantive vacancies. Overall, the case involved multiple matters related to minority status claims of educational institutions, admissions procedures, and seniority issues in government service.[Facts] In this case, Lakshminarayana Iyer, a Hindu Brahmin, owned properties and passed away in 1924, leaving behind his widow Ranganayaki and married daughter Ramalakshmi. In his will, Lakshminarayana directed that Ranganayaki would enjoy the properties during her lifetime, and afterward, Ramalakshmi and her heirs would possess them with full rights of transfer. Ranganayaki obtained possession of the properties upon her husband's death. Ramalakshmi passed away in 1938, and no children survived her. Ranganayaki sold one property in 1945, leading the plaintiff (Ramalakshmi's husband and sole heir) to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration that the sale wouldn't bind him beyond Ranganayaki's lifetime. The plaintiff also sought to restrain Ranganayaki from alienating other properties. An injunction was issued to prevent further alienation. Two settlement deeds were executed by Ranganayaki despite the injunction. The plaintiff amended the suit to challenge these alienations. The main issue revolved around whether Ranganayaki obtained an absolute estate or a widow's estate under the will, and whether Ramalakshmi's interest was contingent or vested. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, a decision upheld by the High Court. After Ranganayaki's death in 1948, the case was appealed to the Supreme Court, focusing on the interpretation of the will and the nature of the interests involved.[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue revolves around whether the estate granted by the testator in his will was a full woman's estate under Hindu law or a limited life estate in the English sense. The primary question is to determine the testator's intent and whether he intended to grant his widow a complete Hindu widow's estate or a more restricted estate. It is established that a Hindu can create various types of estates through a will, including life estates or limited term estates, provided the recipients are capable of inheriting through a deed or will. The focus of the appeal is to discern the testator's intention based on the language used in the will, the surrounding circumstances, customary family relationships, and Hindu notions of property distribution. Upon analyzing the will, the court concluded that the testator intended for his widow to enjoy his properties during her lifetime, after which these properties would be inherited by his daughter and her heirs. The will granted the daughter the power of alienation, while the widow was not explicitly granted such powers. The widow's ability to fulfill obligations under the will without resorting to alienation was taken into consideration. Additionally, the testator's emphasis on creating a new descent for his daughter's heirs indicated his intention for the daughter to enjoy the properties with absolute rights. The court acknowledged that the daughter was not entitled to immediate possession but had a vested interest in the properties from the testator's death. While a Hindu widow enjoys broad powers of alienation under Hindu law, the testator's will did not grant the widow similar extensive powers. The court cited various cases and discussions presented by both sides, highlighting differences in will language, intention, and surrounding circumstances. Ultimately, the court determined that the testator intended to grant the widow a limited life estate rather than a full Hindu widow's estate. The decision underscores the importance of interpreting a will's language within its context and the testator's intentions, and how the nature of the estate granted can vary depending on these factors.[Facts] This appeal involves a dispute over land ownership and compensation for improvements. The appellant filed a suit against the state of Travancore (now Kerala) after being wrongfully dispossessed from 160 acres of land with improvements he had made. The land's ownership was disputed between an illom (family) and the state. The appellant believed the land belonged to the illom and had occupied it, making various improvements. The appellant's application for land registration was rejected, and the illom's lawsuit for title was dismissed. Fearing eviction, the appellant initiated a suit to establish his right to the land. However, the state initiated proceedings against him for eviction, and he was ultimately dispossessed from the land. In the subsequent suit, the appellant claimed compensation for the improvements he had made to the land, contending that the trees on the land should be forfeited under the relevant law and their value awarded to him. The court rejected this claim, stating that the relevant law did not include trees as products that could be forfeited for compensation. The court also argued that compensation for trees could not be granted to a mere trespasser without rights to the land. The court also noted that the appellant's position was similar to that of a tenant. The High Court dismissed the claim for compensation for trees, reasoning that a trespasser, whether bona fide or not, could not claim compensation for trees owned by the state. The appellant's claim was rejected based on these considerations. In summary, the appeal involves a dispute over land ownership and compensation for improvements made by the appellant, who was eventually dispossessed from the land. The court ruled that the appellant could not claim compensation for trees owned by the state, and his claim for compensation was dismissed.[Ratio of the decision] The appellant's argument is that even after the Act was passed, unauthorized occupants of government land who made improvements had a preferential claim for assignment of the land they occupied. The appellant's claim was decreed for the value of his bungalow, but not for other improvements. The appellant's possession commenced after his registration application was rejected, and he attempted to be included in the illom's lawsuit against the government. Therefore, he was not a bona fide trespasser. The court confirmed that the appellant was not a bona fide trespasser, as he was aware of the dispute over land ownership. The court considered whether trees on the land could be considered "other product raised on the land" for forfeiture under the Act. The appellant argued he was entitled to compensation for trees due to his intention to improve the land, but the court rejected this argument, stating that it would encourage wrongful trespassing. The court held that the appellant's claim for compensation was invalid, as he was not a bona fide trespasser and trees could not be considered "other product raised on the land" under the Act. Additionally, the appellant's argument that no eviction notice was given was not entertained, as he had not raised it at earlier stages of the proceedings.[Facts] Three civil appeals have been brought to the Supreme Court arising from three revision petitions to the High Court of Orissa under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951 (Orissa Act I of 1952). The appellant, Shri Achutananda Purohit, was an intermediary in charge of extensive forests and lands within the estate of Jujumura in the Sambalpur district. The dispute concerns the compensation he received, and the case has gone through various stages of adjudication. The compensation officer's initial decision was unfavorable to the appellant, leading to an appeal to the Collector, which was also rejected. The appellant then appealed to the Board of Revenue without success. A revision petition was filed with the High Court, and the order of remand to the compensation officer was the subject of these appeals. The order directed the divisional forest officer to appraise the income from forests, considering factors like the age of trees, and gave the petitioners the opportunity to provide evidence of any tree removal after the vesting date. The compensation officer was to decide the case within six months. The chief conservator had altered the appraisement of the annual income, and this revised figure was accepted by the statutory tribunal, which led to the compensation officer's decision. The appellant's appeals to the Collector and the Board of Revenue were unsuccessful, culminating in the revision petitions to the High Court and the subsequent order of remand.[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue revolves around the quantum of compensation under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951. The appellant, Shri Achutananda Purohit, challenged the compensation he received for his estate, which vested in the state in 1960. He raised nine contentions, each of which the court considered and rejected. The court addressed the appellant's arguments, which included challenges to the interest rate, inflation-adjusted compensation, the slab system of compensation, and more. The court emphasized that the compensation rate, even though it might seem lower due to inflation, was not adjustable under the law. It also highlighted that challenges to compensation amounts based on social transformation were not valid due to constitutional provisions. The court then focused on the statutory methodology for determining compensation, particularly for forest lands. The process involves appraisal by forest officers, with their assessments subject to the approval of the chief conservator of forests. The court clarified that the chief conservator's role is to approve or modify the forest officer's appraisal, rather than conducting an independent assessment. The integrated process, as described by the court, was essential for determining compensation. Despite acknowledging delays and mistakes in the process, the court highlighted the need for compassion, particularly considering the advanced age of the appellant. Ultimately, the court rejected the appellant's arguments and upheld the approach taken by the high court, remanding the case back to the compensation officer for appropriate proceedings.
