[Facts] Tata Consultancy Engineers filed an appeal against a 1978 award by the Industrial Tribunal in Maharashtra, which revised wage scales and benefits for certain employee categories. The company's workforce included engineers, supervisors, and various workmen categories. The tribunal computed the company's gross profits, considering factors like taxation, development rebate, and depreciation, and determined the average profits
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving Tata Consultancy Engineers and their employees' union, revolving around wage scale revisions and dearness allowance. The tribunal's original intention was to revise wage scales, integrate flat increases into those scales, and not provide separate ad hoc increases to individual employees. The court considers whether the correction was within the tribunal's authority and determines that it was, as it rectified an accidental omission

[Facts] The passage discusses two appeals with identical questions regarding the legality of withdrawing benefits as subsidies. The appellants argue that the High Court erred by not considering their counterarguments, presenting undisclosed materials, and violating natural justice. The High Court's factual findings include that the respondents established their units before the subsidy orders and without inducement
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses the legal principles related to vested rights, legitimate expectations, policy changes, arbitrariness, and executive actions. It emphasizes that concessions don't confer vested rights, and promissory estoppel applies when industry relies on government representation. The passage concludes that the High Court's decision wasn't tenable, and that the legality of retrospective withdrawal needs further examination by the court

[Facts] The appeals are against a judgment from a special court regarding transactions in securities. The appellants are related to Harshad S. Mehta and own flats in Mumbai. The custodian sought permission to sell certain properties, while the appellants sought the release of their properties
[Ratio of the decision] The case pertains to the application of a law that provides strict measures for dealing with individuals involved in securities-related offenses. The appellants argue their properties should only be attached for liabilities during the statutory period. The court must consider if the defense arguments can be raised and whether assets and liabilities should be treated separately

[Facts] Three appeals have been filed against a Kolkata High Court judgment dated 25th September 1992. The state took possession, and the Sarkar family challenged the requisition in court. Appeals were filed challenging a court order that directed the collector to take possession from the state and give it to the Sarkar family
[Ratio of the decision] The Calcutta High Court, both the learned single judge and the division bench, made a serious legal mistake by ordering the receiver to take possession of Nalban Fishery from the State of West Bengal and deliver it to the Sarkar family members. The subsequent receiver, who took over the role of district magistrate, had no authority to re-deliver possession of Nalban Fishery to the state, and the subsequent receiver's actions showed bias. The State of West Bengal had not been bound by the earlier compromise decree regarding the fishery

[Facts] Yakshagana is a traditional ballet dance form with a unique heritage. After Dr. Karanth's passing, a performance of his developed Yakshagana took place in New Delhi in 2001. She alleged that Dr. Karanth had developed a distinctive form named "Yaksha Ranga," a creative extension of traditional Yakshagana, and the appellants' performance in New Delhi without her permission violated her copyright
[Ratio of the decision] The court discusses the issues raised in the case related to copyright infringement of Yakshagana performances. It notes that while dramatic literature can be considered a form of literary work, the copyright provisions of the act differentiate between "literary work" and "dramatic work." Thus, if the performances fall under the scope of these clauses, the injunction order does not apply

[Facts] The appellant claimed to be a tenant of two adjacent premises, while the respondent was the landlord. The main dispute was whether the appellant had sublet the premises or allowed the partnership firm to use them. Over time, the partnership firm underwent changes in its composition
[Ratio of the decision] The central issue in this appeal is whether the appellant and his father had sublet the premises in question in accordance with Section 13(1)(e) of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (referred to as the "Rent Act"). The appellant and his father were alleged to have formed a partnership with others to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling neon signs tubes. The court upheld the lower court's decision that the appellant had not sublet the premises, and the partnership did not lead to forfeiture of the tenancy

[Facts] This appeal challenges a judgment from the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated October 3, 2007, where the appellant's appeal was dismissed and the conviction imposed by the Special Judge for CBI Cases was upheld. The complainant, a railway employee seeking a transfer, reported to the CBI that the appellant had demanded a bribe of Rs 200 for processing his transfer request. The appellant appealed against the sentences imposed by the lower courts
[Ratio of the decision] The decision clarifies that when a notice is issued confining arguments to a specific aspect (in this case, the quantum of sentence), the parties are not entitled to raise all points and reopen the case without restriction. The court rejected the appellant's request for a reduction in sentence based on factors such as long delay and loss of employment. The appellant's bail bonds were cancelled

[Facts] This appeal challenges a judgment from the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated August 19, 2011. The incident occurred on November 18, 1994, when a confrontation arose between the complainant, his sons, and the accused. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence and medical testimony
[Ratio of the decision] The court carefully considered the contentions and reviewed the evidence in the case. The injuries were corroborated by medical evidence and the testimony of the injured witnesses. The court took into account the nature of injuries, the passage of time since the incident, and the overall circumstances in determining the appropriate sentences and compensation in this case

[Facts] This special leave appeal arises from a Bombay High Court judgment dated March 1, 2005. The dispute centered around a time charter party agreement between the appellant, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, and the respondent, Great Eastern Shipping Company Limited, for chartering a vessel. The court held that the tribunal had misinterpreted certain clauses of the charter party agreement and that it did indeed have jurisdiction to decide the dispute
[Ratio of the decision] The text examines legal questions in a vessel charter agreement dispute. The failure to do so raises questions about the complete fulfillment of the charter party. The arbitral tribunal's decision on the vessel's non-delivery and the application of charter party clauses is critiqued for not considering this aspect as part of the arbitration agreement

[Facts] The matter involves confusion stemming from the postponed commencement of the Patents Amendment Act 2005. This act lacked provisions for post-grant opposition, which were introduced in the Patents Amendment Act 2005. The case highlights the complexity resulting from amendments and delayed enforcement of different sections of patent-related legislation
[Ratio of the decision] The case revolves around the introduction of a dichotomy in patent law by the Patents Amendment Act 2005, separating opposition to pre-grant and post-grant patents. This led to confusion and legal challenges concerning the jurisdiction of appeals. In the context of these complexities, the court determined that the appeals filed prior to the enforcement of the new law, under the old provisions, should be heard and decided by the High Court

[Facts] An FIR was filed based on the statement of Prakashi Devi, who claimed that the appellant trespassed her house, broke bulbs, and later touched her daughter-in-law, Sheela Devi. The police filed a report, and charges were framed against the appellant for house trespass and assault with intent to outrage modesty. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial
[Ratio of the decision] The central issue is whether an accused can be convicted for an offense against a person (Y) when the charge is framed for an offense against a different person (X), even if the error in the charge did not prejudice the accused or lead to a failure of justice. Substance Over Technicalities: Courts should prioritize the substance of the case over technicalities. Informed Defense: If the accused concentrated their defense on disproving the charges as framed, without trying to challenge evidence related to the actual offense committed, it indicates that they were defending against the actual charge and not the erroneous one

[Facts] This case involves a dispute over the payment of bonus to workers. The tribunal did not establish a link between bonus and dividends or claim that the workers had any rights to the company's reserves or undistributed profits. The case highlights the complexity of determining bonus payments and the consideration of social justice in such matters
[Ratio of the decision] The main question is whether workers are entitled to a bonus even when the employer faced a trading loss in the given year, and whether workers have any rights to company reserves and undistributed profits. The demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim under certain conditions, such as when wages are below living standards and the industry earns substantial profits. Bonus is not a deferred wage and cannot be claimed during a year of trading loss

[Facts] This case involves appeals by four accused individuals who were convicted of murder. Dr. Shardha Prasad Tripathi, the husband of one of the accused, lodged a First Information Report (FIR) upon discovering the crime scene. An eyewitness, Anil Kumar, testified that the accused attacked Bhavna, leading to her death
[Ratio of the decision] The court carefully examined the identification process and the boy's testimony in a case involving a murder. This identification was crucial as the boy had no motive to falsely implicate anyone. The court also discussed the need for corroboration of witness testimony but found the boy's identification reliable and specific

[Facts] The appellants have appealed against a judgment of the High Court dated 25th November 2009 in relation to the acquisition of their agricultural lands by the State of Uttar Pradesh for building the Shahjahanpur district jail. The state government formed a committee to recommend the relocation of congested district jails to less populated areas. The district magistrate forwarded the proposal for land acquisition to the state government, which issued notifications under the Land Acquisition Act on 21st August 2008 without conducting a Section 5A inquiry due to urgency
[Ratio of the decision] The appellants presented several arguments before the court. The court discussed the principles surrounding land acquisition, emphasizing that the Land Acquisition Act is a drastic law with expropriatory implications, and the concept of public purpose in acquisition must align with the principles of a welfare state. The court discussed the scope of a person's right under Section 5A of the Act, which provides for a hearing in cases of urgency

[Facts] The appellants, who were engaged in biscuit manufacturing, appealed against the Customs Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) decision dated 11th April 2000. Ltd., which had the registered trademark for "Meghraj" on its own products. The Commissioner and CEGAT rejected the appeals, holding that the appellants were using the trade name "Meghraj" on their products, which was owned by Kay Aar Biscuits
[Ratio of the decision] The judgment outlines the reasons for rejecting the appellants' arguments and upholding the decisions of the lower authorities. The issuance of a registration certificate under the Trade Marks Act with retrospective effect doesn't confer the benefit of exemption under excise law. Overall, the court found no merit in the appeals and upheld the decisions of the lower authorities

[Facts] This appeal is filed against the order of the Bombay High Court, which dismissed the appellant's Letter Patents Appeal. Subsequent transactions and legal proceedings resulted in conflicting claims over the properties. Ultimately, the State Minister for Revenue reinstated the entries in favor of the respondents, leading to the appellant challenging this decision in the Bombay High Court
[Ratio of the decision] The key legal question in this case is whether a second revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code is permissible and whether the state government has the authority to entertain such a second revision. This means that even if one party approaches a revenue officer for revision, the state government can still be approached for a separate revision. In summary, the court held that under the scheme of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, both the state government and certain revenue officers have the authority to exercise revisional powers

[Facts] The respondent worked as a technical assistant with the Gujarat State Electricity Board. The respondent was transferred to Ukai and was relieved from his previous duties on March 30, 1974. The Chief Engineer discharged him on May 27, 1974, citing continued absence in breach of service regulations
[Ratio of the decision] The appeal challenges the judgment and order of the High Court that allowed the respondent's writ petition, quashed his discharge order from service, and directed his reinstatement. The respondent was transferred several times during his tenure. The Division Bench's finding that the letter of April 24, 1974, was raised for the first time is incorrect, and the respondent failed to rebut the presumption of service when a registered letter is returned with an endorsement of refusal

[Facts] In 1962, the Ministry of Defence acquired land for expanding the Sirsa airfield due to the Chinese invasion. The appellant, Major Som Nath, was accused of permitting the misappropriation of standing crops from the acquired land and accepting an illegal gratification of Rs. A case was registered against him under corruption charges
[Ratio of the decision] This appeal is against the conviction of the accused under Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court examines the order of sanction and concludes that the facts mentioned in it are sufficient to sustain the sanction under Section 5(1)(c). The appellant's argument about witnesses not being called is dismissed as the prosecution had already provided evidence to establish its claims

[Facts] This appeal arises from a case involving the interpretation of phrases in the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. The single judge sided with Subbammal, determining that the 12-week period referred to 12 weeks of work. The establishment appealed, and the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court allowed her claim
[Ratio of the decision] In the case of Cochin v. [Case Name], the key question was the interpretation of the term "week" in relation to the Maternity Benefits Act. The court examined various dictionary definitions and concluded that in the context of the Act, "week" should be understood as a cycle of seven days, including Sundays. In light of this reasoning, the court rejected a previous ruling by the Kerala High Court that held a contrary view

[Facts] The appeals under consideration stem from a shared judgment dated April 26, 2000, issued by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench, pertaining to similar legal and factual questions. The appellants were subsequently appointed and assigned to the "Indore Habitat Project," managed by the Overseas Development Authority (ODA), on daily wages. Based on the evidence and arguments presented, the Labour Court determined that the appellants' work was satisfactory and comparable to employees of the Indore Development Authority
[Ratio of the decision] The dispute in this case centered around whether the appellants' services were employed for the stated project or for the respondent authority. The appellants' claim of regularization was not supported. The court concluded that the appellants' appointments were invalid, their claims for regularization were not valid, and the doctrine of equal pay for equal work did not apply in this context

[Facts] The appellant, Ujjagar Singh, was convicted for the murder of his niece, Mukhtiar Kaur, and sentenced to death, along with additional convictions for offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). She had alleged that the land was fraudulently transferred from her mother. The appellant claimed innocence, stating that he was falsely implicated and had a fatherly relationship with Mukhtiar Kaur
[Ratio of the decision] The court reviewed the evidence and arguments presented in the case. The court discussed the circumstances of the case, including the location of the incident, the presence of the alleged murder weapon, and the absence of witnesses other than the accused and the deceased. The court concluded that the appellant's claim that unknown assailants were responsible for the crime was not credible

[Facts] The appellants claimed to be tenants of agricultural land and filed a declaration seeking occupancy rights in the land. The Appellate Authority also upheld this decision. In summary, the appellants' claim for occupancy rights was rejected by the High Court due to lack of sufficient evidence to establish their tenancy status as required by the Karnataka Land Reforms Act
[Ratio of the decision] The High Court had set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the lower tribunals under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1974. After reviewing the appellants' and respondents' arguments, as well as examining the impugned judgment of the High Court and the lower tribunals' orders, the Supreme Court concluded that the High Court's decision was justified. It declined to interfere using its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution

[Facts] The appellant was a tenant under respondent no. A road widening project was proposed, leading to the acquisition of 867 sq m of land for the public purpose. The appellant challenged the notices, claiming lack of proper notice issuance for allotment and demolition
[Ratio of the decision] The case revolves around the interpretation and application of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act 1976 and the related rules. The court concludes that the appellant's conduct constitutes waiver and estoppel against asserting his rights at this point, as the benefit of the notice provisions was for his benefit alone and not related to public interests. Therefore, he cannot claim equitable relief now

[Facts] The case concerns the grant of a proprietary jagir to the respondent by various hajur orders in the early 20th century. The case revolves around the question of whether the inquiry under the Land Revenue Code could be conducted despite the determination made under the Jagirs Abolition Act regarding the respondent's rights to minerals. The appellants' appeal challenges the High Court's judgment
[Ratio of the decision] The central question in this appeal is whether, once the competent authority declares a jagir (land grant) as proprietary under the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act, 1953, a further inquiry under the Bombay Land Revenue Code (BLRC) is valid to determine the rights of the jagirdar (recipient of the grant) to mines and mineral products within the jagir. In the specific case, the court concludes that the inquiry initiated by the Collector under BLRC was invalid as the respondent had already made applications for recognition of his rights to gravel and stones, and the inquiry was not relevant. The court upholds the High Court's decision to quash the inquiry and grant the injunction

[Facts] The appellant challenges a judgment by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which dismissed their writ appeal on the grounds of non-maintainability. A special leave petition was initially filed with the Supreme Court against the order, which was disposed of on February 16, 2006. The High Court interpreted this disposition as waiving the time limit for filing a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA), but not explicitly directing consideration of the case's merits
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant's objection to the maintainability of the Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) is rejected by the court. The High Court's interpretation of the order as merely waiving the limitation for filing an LPA is incorrect. The court further concludes that the High Court's decision on this matter is incorrect, and the appellant's appeal against the single judge's judgment is indeed maintainable

[Facts] The appellant, a trust, sought permission to establish an engineering college and received conditional approval from the AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) based on expert committee recommendations. The division bench stated that the appellant could reapply for permission or request consideration for a future academic year. The government's counter highlights concerns about infrastructure compliance and the need to assess the demand for engineering graduates and job opportunities
[Ratio of the decision] The points of consideration in the case are as follows: 1. The process of granting approval for new technical institutions involved consultations with various committees, councils, and experts. The court contrasts the Tamil Nadu case's principles with the current case's facts in the state of Kerala

[Facts] This civil appeal is brought by special leave against a judgment and decree dated November 29, 1977, issued by a single judge of the Gujarat High Court. 921 of 1966 filed in the Joint Civil Judge's Court, Baroda. The suit was filed in 1966 for redemption of the mortgages
[Ratio of the decision] Firstly, whether the leasehold rights of a tenant merge into a mortgage security if the same property is given by the landlord to the tenant as mortgage security under a mortgage by conditional sale, preventing the tenant from resisting the landlord's suit for possession recovery by obtaining a redemption decree. In this context, the court examines whether the leasehold estate of a tenant merges into a mortgage security created by the landlord if the same property is used as security for a mortgage by conditional sale. Therefore, the court concludes that the civil court cannot decide the tenancy issue under the BT&AL Act

[Facts] This case involves a dispute over trademark rights. The respondents registered the trademark "Raleigh" and other marks under various trademark acts. The key points of contention were whether unregistered licensees can use registered trademarks and whether the appellant's claim of non-use was valid
[Ratio of the decision] The core question in this case is whether the High Court's decision to refuse the rectification and removal of the respondents' trademarks from the trademark register was correct. Unregistered persons or those not registered under Section 48(1) cannot be considered registered users under Section 46 or any other law. The court noted that in the facts of the case, the appellant was a legitimate user in passing off bicycles under the respondent's trademark

[Facts] In this case, the respondents faced trial for various criminal offenses, including conspiracy and misappropriation, under the Indian Penal Code. The State also filed an application to revise the sentences given to the respondents. The trial court found both respondents guilty of multiple charges, but the High Court acquitted them
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving multiple respondents and charges related to criminal activities within a company. The court's interpretation of these provisions is debated, considering different scenarios involving various charges and respondents. The court emphasizes that the reliability of the approver's testimony should be assessed based on the usual criteria for credibility, such as consistency, corroboration, and material particulars

[Facts] The case revolves around the interpretation of Indian income tax laws related to agricultural income. The question was whether 60% of the dividend she received from these companies could be considered agricultural income and thus exempt from taxation. The High Court upheld the decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, agreeing that the dividend income could be considered agricultural income under the Indian Income Tax Act
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's main point is that the dividend received by a shareholder from a company is not considered agricultural income within the Indian Income Tax Act. The court reasoned that the dividend is not directly derived from the shareholder's connection with the land where agricultural activities take place. This right exists independently of any dividend declaration

[Facts] The case involves a member of the Madras Legislative Assembly who was initially disqualified due to a conviction but sought exemption to run for a by-election. The member challenged this process in court, arguing that the disqualification existed before the election and should have been challenged through an election tribunal. The member sought a writ of mandamus or prohibition against the Commission's reference
[Ratio of the decision] The court held that the power of the high court to issue writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is subject to limitations: the writs cannot extend beyond the court's territorial jurisdiction, and the person or authority to whom the writs are issued must be within that jurisdiction. The court found that the High Court of Madras lacked jurisdiction to issue a writ against the Election Commission since the Commission was located in Delhi. Furthermore, the court examined the question of disqualification of a member of the legislature and whether the term "become subject to disqualification" in Articles 190(3) and 192(1) of the Constitution referred to disqualifications arising after election

[Facts] The case involves a respondent who was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The initial investigation by Subinspector Mathur was conducted without obtaining the required permission from a magistrate. The Court emphasized that irregularities in investigation alone cannot lead to acquittal unless they seriously prejudice the accused
[Ratio of the decision] The court determined that the accused's conviction should not be set aside due to irregularities in the investigation process. However, Mathur rectified this by subsequently obtaining the required permission from a magistrate of the 1st class. Therefore, the accused's conviction was upheld, and the curative provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure were not invoked

[Facts] The appellant company purchased surplus materials through contracts and disputes arose with the Union of India, leading to arbitration. They argued that the umpire failed to consider certain documents, misinterpreted the scope of sales, and acted beyond jurisdiction. Specifically, the dispute included questions about vehicles sold and removed by the appellant
[Ratio of the decision] The ratio of the decision revolves around the interpretation of the Arbitration Act (1940), Section 30 regarding the setting aside of an award due to an error apparent on the face of the award. An arbitrator's decision, even if based on a legal proposition, is not necessarily unsound on the face of the award. The mere consideration of a legal point doesn't incorporate a document into the award

[Facts] In a legal case dated April 11, 1969, involving civil appeal number 165 of 1974 and related matters, the court dismissed the appeal and special leave petitions. The court ordered an ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to the appellant as a final settlement for their claim. The deposited amounts with the trial court could be withdrawn by the respondents
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the High Court interpreted Section 7d and determined that its benefits applied only to those whose land occupation had a lawful origin. The High Court's decision to deny protection under Section 7d was upheld. The appeal was dismissed, and the court directed an ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000, with the observation that this decision did not affect the matter of rubber tree ownership

[Facts] In this legal case, plaintiffs filed a suit against defendants claiming ownership of a disputed property. The appellate court then evaluated the evidence, finding that the plaintiffs had been in continuous possession of the entire land, including the part with the defendants' house. The defendants were directed to remove their house and return vacant possession of the plot to the plaintiffs
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the defendants, who are the appellants, were being sued by the plaintiffs for ownership of a disputed property. The defendants initially opposed the construction by the plaintiffs on a part of the land but later agreed. The court determined that the plaintiffs had also acknowledged the land as the defendants' property, and the defendants' possession had lasted for many years, establishing the plea of adverse possession

[Facts] The petitioners filed a petition under Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1973, along with Order XXXVI of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966. This was done during the investigation stage of their case, seeking a transfer of their case to a different court. However, the court dismissed their petition for transfer
[Ratio of the decision] The court clarified that while Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the transfer of appeals from one high court or subordinate court to another, it does not grant authority to transfer investigations from one police station to another across the country merely based on the forwarding of initial information or remand reports to a court. Since there was no pending case before any court, the court dismissed the petition. The court advised that if the petitioners were concerned about the inconvenience of travel or judicial process, they should seek appropriate remedies through other means, as justice should be pursued without causing harassment

[Facts] Ishroo Devi filed a suit to recover certain properties based on a will executed by Purohit Mani Ram. The trial court accepted the evidence of witnesses who attested to the authenticity of the will and ruled in favor of the respondent. The trial court found that two of the properties were ancestral, and the will was valid
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court examined the validity of a testamentary will that disposed of ancestral property to a distant relative. The main issues addressed were whether the will was valid under the Jammu & Kashmir Hindu Succession Act and whether the income of a hereditary priest could be considered as ancestral property. The court found that the will was valid, rejecting claims of forgery and unnaturalness

[Facts] In this case, a writ petition was filed to challenge an order of detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974. The detenu's representation raised several points. The court held that under Clauses 4 and 5 of Article 22 of the Constitution, the detenu has a dual right: 1) the right to have the representation considered, irrespective of the length of detention, and 2) the right to challenge the legality of the detention
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court considered the issue of delay in deciding a representation filed by a detenu under Article 22(5) of the Indian Constitution. The court emphasized that the obligation of the detaining authority to decide the representation is distinct from the obligation to constitute a review board. In this specific case, the representation was not explained or detailed in a timely manner, which rendered the detention void

[Facts] Special leave was granted by the court, and a delay of six days in filing the case was condoned. Subsequently, on 1st December 1973, another notification was issued that brought cotton fabrics under the purview of sales tax, specifically within Item No. 18 of the schedule as added by Section 4 of the said Act
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled on the issue of taxation based on notifications under the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act. The court stated that the power to grant exemptions and vary tax rates rested with the state government, and the absence of a notification withdrawing an earlier exemption did not prevent the imposition of tax through a subsequent notification. The majority judges held that the exemption applied as long as it existed, even if specific items were notified for taxation under a different provision

[Facts] The case involves a joint family business with a sugar factory. The receiver of the factory claimed enhanced depreciation allowance based on the value of a partner's share, but the claim was rejected. The appellant appealed against these decisions
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the appellant received amounts from partners due to lease termination, claimed depreciation on a 1/6th share in a sugar mill acquired through exchange, and sought to set off an unabsorbed loss against income. The court held that the amounts received were taxable income as they were in the nature of profits from business interest. The appellant's appeals were dismissed in all instances

[Facts] This legal case pertains to the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973, involving sections such as 3, 4(1), 15(2), and 40(1). The act introduced changes to the earlier Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, which aimed to determine ceiling areas for agricultural holdings. In 1973, a new ordinance repealed certain provisions and recognized specific transfers made during the old law's operation
[Ratio of the decision] In the decision's core, the court considered whether certain provisions of the old law should be upheld despite the enactment of the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973. Thus, the provisions of the old law were applicable to these cases. In summary, the court's decision determined that accrued rights and incurred liabilities under the old law were preserved and applicable to pending cases, despite the enactment of the new law

[Facts] This case involves an appeal against the dismissal of a writ petition by the Allahabad High Court. The appellant appealed against this to the Supreme Court. The tribunal and the High Court's decisions were upheld, and the court dismissed the appeal, ordering the appellant to be paid Rs 75,000 by the Jal Nigam within three months
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's key points are as follows: 1. The court highlighted that for compulsory retirement, stale adverse entries from over ten years ago should not be considered, and only recent service records should be taken into account, provided adverse entries had been communicated to the employee. In conclusion, the appellant's appeal was dismissed, and while the court did not interfere with the termination, they directed the U.P. Jal Nigam to pay the appellant Rs 50,000 within four months

[Facts] In this case, the appellant challenged his dismissal from service through a series of legal actions. However, the High Court dismissed the suit on the grounds that complex factual issues were involved. Ultimately, the legal proceedings revolved around the appellant's dismissal from service and whether the dismissal order was valid under the law
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the appellant's dismissal from service was challenged in court. The Supreme Court concluded that the dismissal order was passed in violation of a mandatory provision and was therefore null and void. Despite this, the proper course of action was not to automatically set aside the dismissal order, but rather to require the employer to furnish a copy of the proceeding to the appellant and assess whether the failure to provide the copy had prejudiced the appellant's case

[Facts] The appellant in this case, M/s United Glass Bangalore, is a manufacturing unit within the Khoday group of industries, engaged in bottling alcoholic beverages. They issued show cause notices proposing to redetermine the values of the bottles. The Collector of Central Excise appealed to the Customs, Excise, and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, which found that the appellant's declared prices were far below cost and unacceptable
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the respondents are directed to pay differential duties as the department is entitled to finalize assessments based on the value of goods supplied within the Khoday group. The rule states that when the manufacturer doesn't sell the goods but uses them in manufacturing, the value of comparable goods sold by another assessee can be adopted as the basis for valuation. The appellant argues that once the revenue adopts a value, it cannot switch to another basis, which the court disagrees with, stating that such a stance isn't supported by the law

[Facts] In this case, the appellant is challenging a land acquisition process. A notification was issued in 1985 to acquire 5 acres and 21 gunthas of land for the construction of the Hemavathi left bank canal. 4800 per acre, but the Civil Judge later increased it to Rs
[Ratio of the decision] After examining the case's details, it has been concluded that a reasonable compensation of Rs. A3 (a document) has been presented, but it pertains to land with coconut trees and is irrelevant for this case's compensation determination. The respondent is entitled to enhanced compensation

[Facts] In the given case, the appellants were accused of murdering a gram sarpanch. The Supreme Court analyzed the evidence and found the High Court's judgment erroneous. The Court also discussed the reliability of witnesses and their motives
[Ratio of the decision] In the given case, the Supreme Court found that the High Court's decision to convict the accused only of the offence under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code was erroneous. The Court observed discrepancies in the witnesses' accounts, their relationship with the deceased, and their presence at the scene of the occurrence. The appeal of two of the accused was allowed, and their convictions were set aside

[Facts] This case involves an appeal arising from a Karnataka High Court order dated 19th September 1990. The respondents, Doddaramaiah and Chikkaramaiah, were granted agricultural land under Rule 43(8) of the Mysore Land Revenue Code. The issue revolves around whether the respondents challenging the sale of land to the appellant are estopped from doing so and whether the sale is valid, along with considering whether the appellant perfected his title by adverse possession
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978, which prevents the alienation of assigned land intended for the economic betterment of marginalized communities. The appellant had acquired the land through a registered sale deed before the act was enacted. The court's earlier decision (Veeranna vs. State of Karnataka) on the same issue affirmed that adverse possession does not apply against the state unless the purchaser has a valid title

[Facts] The appellant was dismissed from service based on a dismissal order dated April 24, 1987, issued by the employer (respondent no. 1) following an inquiry into charges against the appellant. The appellant challenged his dismissal through an industrial dispute, and the state government referred the dispute for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal
[Ratio of the decision] The Supreme Court reviewed the case and found that the reasons given by the High Court for allowing the withdrawal of the approval application were not sustainable. The Court disagreed with the notion that proceedings under Section 6(e)(2)(b) and those on reference under Section 4(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act cannot be allowed to continue simultaneously. In essence, the Court kept all questions open for further consideration

[Facts] The appeal pertains to a case in which the appellant union claimed to represent workers in a canteen operated by the respondents. The union asserted that even though the workers were effectively employees of the respondents, the respondents treated them differently and engaged contractors to run the canteen. The High Court of Bombay had previously ruled that under the MRTU&PULP Act, the industrial court cannot convert contract labor into direct employees of the company, which influenced the appellant's direct appeal to the Supreme Court
[Ratio of the decision] The decision states that the provisions of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act (MRTU&PULP Act) can only be enforced by individuals who are confirmed as workmen. Only after the workmen status is established can a complaint be filed under the MRTU&PULP Act. The court also emphasized that any observations or findings made by the industrial court in the impugned order would not affect the decision made in the appropriate forum regarding the employment status dispute

[Facts] This case involves two tenants who were renting a property owned jointly by two sisters. The property was later divided through partition proceedings, and the tenants claimed that the owners treated them unfairly and engaged contractors to run a canteen on the premises. The industrial court dismissed the complaint, stating that the tenants' workmen status needed to be resolved before filing a complaint under the MRTU&PULP Act
[Ratio of the decision] This case involves co-owned property that was divided through partition proceedings. The property had two tenants who continued to hold their tenancies. The court ruled that this partial transfer did not result in a merger of the tenancy, and the tenancy rights were not extinguished

[Facts] The appellant is contesting a case wherein the second respondent filed a complaint against the appellant and his wife under the Prized Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Prohibition) Act and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court determined that the magistrate was authorized to order an investigation in a private complaint case under Section 156(3) of the CrPC and that such an investigation is necessary in the public interest. The appellant is now contesting this decision in an appeal
[Ratio of the decision] The accused challenged the legality of an order for investigation issued by a magistrate in response to a private complaint. Different High Courts had taken differing views on this matter. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that a magistrate's order for investigation under Section 156(3) can be made without examining the complainant on oath or the witnesses present at the time of filing the complaint

[Facts] This case involves a motor accident claim brought before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Ludhiana. The Tribunal found that the victim's death resulted from the negligent driving of the second respondent, whose vehicle was insured by the appellant insurance company. The appellant insurance company contested, arguing that as the vehicle was a goods vehicle, they shouldn't be liable for passengers
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the issue revolves around whether an insurance policy for a goods vehicle covers gratuitous passengers. The court examines the impact of a 1994 legislative amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act, which added the phrase "including the owner of the goods or his authorized representative carried in the vehicle." The court emphasizes that the legislative intention was to provide third-party risk coverage and that the changes introduced in the 1988 Act differ from the 1939 Act's provisions

[Facts] Residents of Santiniketan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Calcutta High Court, concerned about the defacement of the ambiance and environment around Visva Bharati University. The PIL particularly focused on proposed constructions in the Khoai area, involving the West Bengal Housing Board and Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. Unauthorised structures on the plot had been mostly removed, with revenue from the project intended for other public projects. The Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA) had undertaken various public benefit works in the area
[Ratio of the decision] The act establishing Visva Bharati University was enacted with the aim of preserving its uniqueness, tradition, and special features as a unitary teaching and residential university. The Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA) should distinguish itself from other development authorities, considering the environmental impact and the university's distinct character. The Court recognized the need to balance development and preservation, allowing ongoing construction by Bengal Peerless while directing SSDA to abide by legal provisions and previous observations in future activities

[Facts] The case involves two appeals filed against a judgment by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in favor of the Coast Guard and the underwriters of a vessel. The vessel, named "Kobe Queen" or "Gloira Kopp," was found loaded with steel products in Indian territorial waters. The crew sought wages from the vessel's sale proceeds, but the Coast Guard opposed, resulting in legal proceedings
[Ratio of the decision] The decision of the court can be summarized as follows: 1. The court disagreed with the contention that the crew's right to wages is extinguished by the ship's confiscation. The decision criticized the division bench's interpretation of the Customs Act and emphasized the importance of protecting the rights of workers, especially in the context of maritime law

[Facts] The respondent in this case sought a modification of the price indicated in an allotment letter issued by the appellants for land acquisition. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel argued that there was confusion regarding co-sharer entitlements for the plot and that previous decisions established principles relating to allotments. In summary, the case involves a dispute over land allotment pricing due to co-ownership claims
[Ratio of the decision] The case involves an allotment scheme for residential plots to individuals whose land was acquired for urban development. The respondent had agreed to the prevalent rates of the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA) in an affidavit accompanying his application for allotment. The appellant's rate mentioned in the allotment letter from 2001 stands

[Facts] The appeals challenge a Karnataka High Court judgment dated February 15, 2001, concerning Defense Research & Development Organization (DRDO) technical cadre recruitment rules. The appellants, former chargemen grade II in the Ministry of Defence, sought to invalidate Rule 6(4)(a) of the DRDO recruitment rules, claiming it violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Rule 6(4)(a) placed individuals with specific qualifications in a higher grade (category II) and others in a lower grade (category I)
[Ratio of the decision] The court rejected the appellants' argument that Rule 6(4)(a) violated Article 14 of the Constitution by adversely affecting their promotion prospects. The court emphasized that established legal precedents support the practice of categorization based on educational qualifications. It reiterated that such categorization is permissible under Article 14, and the fact that chargemen grade II with the qualifications mentioned in the rule's schedule were placed in a more favorable category was not a violation of the principle

[Facts] The appellant was a defendant in a suit concerning a property in West Bengal. The plaintiff claimed ownership of the property based on registered deeds of conveyance. The appellant argued that the true owners of the property were not parties to the suit and that the ex parte decree would cause irreparable harm
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that the mistake in describing the suit property was an accidental error and not intentional, and thus, the plaintiff's application for amendment of the plaint and decree was permissible. If the amendment is necessary to correct accidental slips or omissions, it is within the scope of Section 152, but if it goes to the merits of the case or is intentional, other remedies like appeal, revision, or review should be sought. The court also ruled that parties not bound by the decree were not entitled to impleadment

[Facts] The case involves appellants who were appointed as chargeman grade II, and due to a slight difference in marks, they were appointed as supervisor grade A. A government order allowed them to appear in the next examination to qualify as chargeman grade II. The central administrative tribunal allowed the appellants' application, directing the authorities to fix their seniority and benefits. The order was partially modified by the Supreme Court, and the central government challenged it
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that appellants who were graded as supervisor grade A should be allowed another chance to take an examination to become chargeman grade II. This policy would have retrospective effect to cover past cases where the authorities had already allowed supervisory apprentices another chance. The court criticized the denial of benefits to the appellants despite similar cases receiving them, finding this unjustifiable

[Facts] The cases involve disputes related to passenger status and insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act. In one category of cases, the question pertains to unauthorized passengers and their entitlement to insurance claims. The judgments of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals, as well as the High Courts, vary based on the evidence and circumstances presented
[Ratio of the decision] The cases involve the interpretation of insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act, specifically section 147. Therefore, insurance policies wouldn't be liable for passengers in goods vehicles under this Act. The judgments also clarify that the absence of insurance coverage for passengers in goods vehicles isn't a violation of the policy and doesn't warrant denying compensation to claimants

[Facts] This case involves an appeal challenging the judgment of a single judge of the Orissa High Court. The Supreme Court examines the principles governing such situations. In the present case, the court notes that the interest of the legal representatives is contingent as it involves claiming arrears of salary based on the overturning of the conviction
[Ratio of the decision] In cases where an appeal is against a sentence of fine, it may be continued even after the death of the appellant. In this case, the widow of the deceased appellant, who has been brought on record as the legal representative, is entitled to continue the appeal since the sentence of fine directly affects the property. Although a statutory period of 30 days is fixed for such applications, the court notes that the application was filed nearly a year later without an acceptable explanation for the delay

[Facts] This case involves a State appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Criminal Appeal No. The respondent, Kalyan Singh, was acquitted of charges related to the killing of two individuals during a conflict. The prosecution argued that Kalyan Singh fired shots leading to the deaths, while the defense presented an alternative version that implicated others
[Ratio of the decision] The State appeals against the acquittal in Criminal Appeal No. The High Court had acquitted the respondent, Kalyan Singh, due to certain circumstances creating doubt about the prosecution's case. The State contends that factors like the delay in recording statements of certain witnesses, discrepancies in reports, and the failure to send the report to the nearest magistrate were relevant and material

[Facts] The appellant challenges an order by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Criminal Petition No. The appellant filed a complaint against respondents, alleging dishonoring of a cheque. The High Court quashed the complaint against the fourth respondent, stating that the complaint was not properly signed by the payee's power of attorney holder
[Ratio of the decision] The crux of the decision is that a complaint signed by an attorney holder is maintainable for offences under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court concludes that a proprietary concern (sole proprietorship) can file a complaint in the name of the concern itself, either by the proprietor, by describing the concern as a sole proprietary concern represented by the proprietor, or by the attorney holder under a valid power of attorney. The assumption that a complaint by an attorney holder of a proprietary concern is not valid is incorrect, and such a complaint is maintainable

[Facts] This case involves an appeal against a division bench's order that allowed a letters patent appeal filed by respondents against a single judge's order in a writ petition. The appellant raised the preliminary objection that the appeal was not maintainable. The division bench held that the single judge's decision was incorrect, remanding the case back to the single bench for proper consideration
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that a person can resort to writ jurisdiction when they are unable to file a suit under Subsection (1) of Section 8. If a matter is inadequately dealt with or dismissed without proper consideration, it should be set aside, and the issue should be fully addressed. Questions of title or the competency of the settler to establish trust can be resolved in civil suits

[Facts] In this case, the appellant sought permission to run a co-education school, which was granted initially but challenged by the first respondent who already ran a secondary school. Subsequently, the permission was canceled and later reconsidered, leading to a legal battle. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the appellant to run the school based on regulations and their initial permission
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant sought permission to run a school, which was granted and later canceled due to legal challenges. The objection to the school's continuation was raised by the first respondent, a rival school, claiming there was no need for another school and that competition might lead to closure of existing schools. The appellant's school had been running for nearly eight years without negatively affecting the rival school

[Facts] The appellant was a witness in a criminal case where he reported an assault and his statement was recorded during the investigation. Subsequently, a complaint was filed accusing the appellant of conspiring in the crime. The High Court stated that the appellant was not an accused in the police case and the protection against self-incrimination could not be extended
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant was involved in a criminal case as a witness where he provided a statement during the investigation. However, if a question arose during his testimony that could incriminate him, he could claim protection then. The court emphasized that the appellant's situation didn't warrant granting blanket protection and clarified that his right to refuse answering self-incriminating questions would be upheld during the trial

[Facts] The appellant filed a criminal revision in the Supreme Court of India after respondents 2 to 8 were acquitted by the trial court for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appellant, who was the informant in the case, argued that the trial court didn't take adequate measures to secure the attendance of prosecution witnesses, leading to the wrongful acquittal. However, the High Court rejected the revision petition, stating that the trial court had indeed taken reasonable steps to secure witness attendance
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant filed a criminal appeal (No. 1145 of 2003) in the Supreme Court of India, being dissatisfied with the High Court's decision in the case involving Sukhdeo Jha

[Facts] Dr. Sadankumar Goel, the husband of the deceased Dr. Asha Goel, filed a criminal writ petition (No. 1930 of 2006) requesting that the authorities take appropriate action under Section 166A of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court directed the investigating agency to send the collected materials to a forensic laboratory in Canada for examination, as Dr. Asha Goel was a Canadian citizen of Indian origin
[Ratio of the decision] The High Court's decision to direct the investigating agency to send materials for forensic examination to Canada was based on the lack of suitable facilities for mitochondrial DNA analysis in India. The respondent countered that the appellant's objection was an attempt to avoid materials that could implicate the accused, and the state government acknowledged the unavailability of mitochondrial DNA testing facilities in India. The Court concluded that the evidentiary value of the materials could be assessed during the trial, and it was not appropriate to intervene at this point

[Facts] The case involves the Indian Institute of Technology (the Institute) and its employees who were initially hired as junior and senior research assistants, and technical assistants. Some of the employees filed a petition seeking classification as academic staff. The Institute challenged this order, arguing that post classification is the Institute's prerogative under statute 11 and should be based on functions and duties
[Ratio of the decision] The Supreme Court ruled that the classification of posts within the Indian Institute of Technology (the Institute) is determined by the functions and duties performed by the employees. However, since the posts of laboratory superintendents had not been classified under any specified category, and since they were considered as supernumerary posts, the Court ordered that until their classification is determined, the respondents (employees) should retain their original category classification before their promotion to laboratory superintendents. The Court further directed the Institute's Board of Governors to classify the post of laboratory superintendent under the relevant statute, taking into account their duties
