[Facts] The appellant is a company engaged in cigarette manufacturing and sales. The single judge ruled in favor of the respondents, stating that a writ of mandamus would apply when a public duty is imposed on a private management. The case rests on the status of the canteen workers as the appellant's employees, irrespective of a subsequent decision
[Ratio of the decision] The decision discusses the distinction between private and public functions when determining the applicability of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution. However, not all decisions made during public functions are subject to judicial review, particularly when other branches of law or contracts govern the dispute. The court concluded that the appellant company was not amenable to writ jurisdiction and that the canteen workers were not its employees for all purposes

[Facts] The case involves disputes related to the compensation for land acquisition and auction of land owned by M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd (referred to as "the company"). The High Court ordered compensation payment based on a compromise between the state and the company. The state and the company both challenged this decision
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the case where a company had financial difficulties and a receiver was appointed by the District Collector. The High Court issued an order directing compensation payments based on a compromise between the state and the company. The court ruled that equitable grounds warranted interest on the refunded amount, given that the auction purchasers had deposited the full amount and the title had been transferred to them

[Facts] The manufacturer of the drug "Barlagan Ketone" reported its price to the central government in 1971. Following the Drugs Prices Control Order of 1979, which aimed to fix maximum prices for essential and non-essential bulk drugs, the manufacturer applied for a price of Rs 8,500 per kg. The central government issued notifications to fix maximum prices for various bulk drugs, including Barlagan Ketone, but these notifications were challenged and quashed by the Delhi High Court due to a lack of adherence to principles of natural justice
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving allegations of exploitation in the pharmaceutical market and high pricing by manufacturers of bulk drugs. It also clarifies that fairness doesn't require giving manufacturers an opportunity in the price fixation process, as the primary focus is on consumers' interests. The text emphasizes the legislative nature of price fixation and the government's role in securing fair prices for consumers

[Facts] The accused, Pathan Hussain Basha, was married to Pathan Haseena Begum, now deceased, in an arranged marriage. Due to non-payment, the accused and his family harassed and subjected the deceased to cruelty. The parents of the deceased found her hanging, untied her, and took her to the hospital, but she was declared dead
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the evidence presented by the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused in relation to charges under Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC. The prosecution established that the deceased died by hanging and that she had informed her family about the harassment. The court discussed the concept of deeming fiction in criminal law, indicating that once the basic ingredients of the offense are proven, a presumption arises that the accused caused the death

[Facts] This appeal concerns a property dispute involving various parties. Dwarka Nath Ghose owned properties and dedicated them to a family idol through a will. His son Rajendra confirmed this dedication and made his own will, appointing his brother Jogendra as executor
[Ratio of the decision] The main points of the court's decision are as follows: 1. The second contention regarding adverse possession by Nagendra is not upheld. In summary, the court upholds the dedication of the property to the deity and dismisses the argument of adverse possession by Nagendra due to his role as a shebait

[Facts] The case involves twelve accused individuals who were tried for various offenses, including murder, attempted murder, and terrorism charges under TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act) in Pune. The victims were assaulted with swords, satturs, and sticks. The trial court acquitted some accused due to lack of identification but convicted the appellants based on strong evidence and testimony
[Ratio of the decision] The appellants have appealed their convictions and sentences under Section 19 of TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act) after being found guilty in a case where a minor altercation escalated into the death of an individual and injuries to others. The incident involved an attack by the accused, armed with weapons, on the victims. The court found that the charge under Section 3 of TADA was not established based on the facts of the case, as there was no evidence to show that the attack was intended to strike terror within a particular community

[Facts] This case involves the interpretation of Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The first respondent filed a suit alleging infringement and sought an injunction. The central issues revolve around the use of the trademark, the assignment of the trademark to the appellant, and whether the rectification application was valid
[Ratio of the decision] The key issue in this case is the maintainability of an application under Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act. However, such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved. The Act's intention is not to create a "sunset law" but to determine the validity of trade mark rights on a case-by-case basis

[Facts] The case involves an appeal by the State of Manipur against a judgment and order passed by the Guwahati High Court. Despite initially denying involvement in the appointments, he later affirmed in an affidavit that he had indeed issued appointment orders. However, he claimed not to have access to the relevant files after retirement
[Ratio of the decision] The respondents in the case filed writ petitions before the High Court challenging the cancellation of their appointments. The appointments of the respondents were cancelled because they were deemed to be made without the knowledge of the Revenue Department and were considered invalid. The Court also highlighted that the Commissioner of Revenue was not the appointing authority and did not possess the power to issue appointment letters

[Facts] The appellant in this case was detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). The appellant was detained based on these allegations. The crux was whether the withheld documents were material for the appellant's effective representation, as their non-supply could render the detention order invalid
[Ratio of the decision] In this legal case, the appellant's detention is being discussed. Despite some explanation for the delay, the court questions why the detention order took four months to be issued after the proposal for detention was made. The court also mentions that relevant documents, including statements of the appellant and another individual, were not provided to the detaining authority

[Facts] This is an appeal against a judgment by the Bombay High Court affirming the conviction of the appellants under Section 304 B read with Section 34 IPC. 1, and allegedly suffered harassment from the appellants related to dowry demands. Bhimabai complained about harassment and beatings by her husband and mother-in-law
[Ratio of the decision] The main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money, harassment, and beating towards Bhimabai are her parents, specifically PW1 Tukaram and PW5 Sumanbai. Notably, her statement under Section 161 Cr. The evidence doesn't establish the essential element of dowry demand as defined in the Dowry Prohibition Act

[Facts] This appeal is based on the judgment and order dated 01-07-2002 passed by the Bombay High Court at Goa. The incident occurred on 19-04-1988, where the appellant, along with other accused individuals and two juvenile offenders, allegedly formed an unlawful assembly. The appellant, being aggrieved by his conviction, filed this appeal
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court reviews the facts to better understand the arguments presented by both parties. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased suffered fatal stab injuries inflicted by the appellant. The court further examines the medical evidence, pointing out that although there were minor discrepancies between the ocular evidence and the postmortem report, the cause of death was established as a stab injury caused by the appellant

[Facts] In suit number 493 of 1986, filed in the Bombay City Civil Court by Vicco Laboratories against defendants 1 to 4, the appellant claimed exclusive rights to the title and content of the TV serial "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi." The defendants, on the other hand, claimed that they were the producers of the serial and that the petitioners (Vicco Laboratories) were sponsors. The trial court concluded that the petitioners failed to prove that the defendants produced the serial as their agents or that they owned the copyright
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's core principle lies in the understanding that copyright isn't attached to mere ideas but rather to the actual work produced. The courts below correctly analyzed the situation. As for the claim based on Section 17 of the Copyright Act, the respondents didn't create the serial as agents for the petitioners or at their instance, and thus, the issue of copyright ownership under Section 17(b) and (c) doesn't apply

[Facts] The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has appealed against a judgment dated March 26, 2004, by the Delhi High Court. The High Court granted probation under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, to the second respondent, Gurcharan Singh, but upheld the conviction. Displeased with the High Court's decision, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi filed an appeal in the Supreme Court
[Ratio of the decision] The court reviewed the case's documents and heard arguments from the involved parties. Two questions of law were raised: 1) Whether the High Court correctly extended the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, without seeking a conduct report on the accused, and 2) Whether the High Court's decision was correct considering the respondent's previous conviction. The court found that the respondent had withheld information about a previous conviction, which amounted to playing fraud on the court

[Facts] The case involves an appeal against the Madras High Court's decision to acquit the accused, who was originally convicted under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by a lower court. It was noted that the initial investigating officer (PW 40) had made efforts to falsely implicate other individuals, including the victim's family members, and even initiated a departmental proceeding based on fabricated documents. The reliability of PW 40's evidence was questioned due to these actions
[Ratio of the decision] The decision emphasizes the principles of evaluating circumstantial evidence in a criminal case. Inference of guilt must be based on inculpatory facts that are incompatible with the accused's innocence and cannot be explained by any reasonable alternative hypothesis. The court underscores that the fact discovered must be relevant to the issue and connected with the crime, and the discovery must result from information given by the accused

[Facts] This case involves three appeals against an order from the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), which ordered the removal of the "Infosys" trademark from the trade register. Infosys Technologies Limited filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court in 1992, seeking to prevent Jupiter Infosys Limited from using the term. Jupiter Infosys Limited filed applications before the Madras High Court under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958 (1958 Act) for removal and rectification of registered trademarks
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court considered the question of whether the first respondent, Jupiter Infosys Limited, was an "aggrieved person" with the standing to apply for the removal and rectification of the "Infosys" trademark registered by the appellant, Infosys Technologies Limited. However, the interpretation of "aggrieved person" differs between these sections. If the applicant's grievance no longer exists due to their own actions, waiver, loss of interest, or any other reason, there might not be sufficient justification for rectification

[Facts] This appeal arises from a judgment and order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated April 15, 1986. In 1948, the ruler of Mukkalla state, Sail Nawaz Jung, settled some properties in favor of his son Sultan Awaz and grandson Galib Bin Awaz. Ultimately, the high court ruled that Abdul Khader was indeed a protected tenant and entitled to compensation for the acquired property
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue is whether the high court was correct in upholding the arbitrator's award in favor of Abdul Khader, entitling him to 60% of the compensation for the acquired land. The appellants argue that since there was no finding by the revenue officer that Abdul Khader was a protected tenant, the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction in deciding his protected tenancy status. However, the court disagrees, stating that the central act mandates compensation to individuals with an interest in the acquired land

[Facts] In the case, a series of orders and directions were issued by the court regarding admissions to educational institutions for different academic sessions. Additionally, the case involved contempt petitions related to seniority issues among promotees and direct recruits in the government service, stemming from previous cases, including K.C. Joshi v. State of Uttar Pradesh. Overall, the case involved a complex series of orders and directions addressing admissions and seniority issues in educational institutions and government service
[Ratio of the decision] In this case concerning admissions to professional courses in various educational institutions claiming minority status, the court reframed questions for consideration. Institutions in Kerala that were governed by agreements with the government were required to follow those agreements for admissions. The court directed the determination of inter se seniority between direct recruits and promotees based on established rules

[Facts] In this case, Lakshminarayana Iyer, a Hindu Brahmin, owned properties and passed away in 1924, leaving behind his widow Ranganayaki and married daughter Ramalakshmi. Ranganayaki sold one property in 1945, leading the plaintiff (Ramalakshmi's husband and sole heir) to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration that the sale wouldn't bind him beyond Ranganayaki's lifetime. Two settlement deeds were executed by Ranganayaki despite the injunction
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue revolves around whether the estate granted by the testator in his will was a full woman's estate under Hindu law or a limited life estate in the English sense. Ultimately, the court determined that the testator intended to grant the widow a limited life estate rather than a full Hindu widow's estate. The decision underscores the importance of interpreting a will's language within its context and the testator's intentions, and how the nature of the estate granted can vary depending on these factors

[Facts] This appeal involves a dispute over land ownership and compensation for improvements. The appellant believed the land belonged to the illom and had occupied it, making various improvements. In summary, the appeal involves a dispute over land ownership and compensation for improvements made by the appellant, who was eventually dispossessed from the land
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant's argument is that even after the Act was passed, unauthorized occupants of government land who made improvements had a preferential claim for assignment of the land they occupied. Therefore, he was not a bona fide trespasser. The court held that the appellant's claim for compensation was invalid, as he was not a bona fide trespasser and trees could not be considered "other product raised on the land" under the Act

[Facts] Three civil appeals have been brought to the Supreme Court arising from three revision petitions to the High Court of Orissa under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951 (Orissa Act I of 1952). The compensation officer was to decide the case within six months. The chief conservator had altered the appraisement of the annual income, and this revised figure was accepted by the statutory tribunal, which led to the compensation officer's decision
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue revolves around the quantum of compensation under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951. The appellant, Shri Achutananda Purohit, challenged the compensation he received for his estate, which vested in the state in 1960. It also highlighted that challenges to compensation amounts based on social transformation were not valid due to constitutional provisions
