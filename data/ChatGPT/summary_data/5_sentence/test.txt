[Facts] The appellant is a company engaged in cigarette manufacturing and sales. The single judge ruled in favor of the respondents, stating that a writ of mandamus would apply when a public duty is imposed on a private management. The division bench affirmed this view, stating that the duty must be a positive obligation to the affected party. The High Court dismissed a subsequent writ petition. The case rests on the status of the canteen workers as the appellant's employees, irrespective of a subsequent decision
[Ratio of the decision] The decision discusses the distinction between private and public functions when determining the applicability of judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution. The authors of "De Smith, Woolf, and Jowell's Judicial Review of Administrative Action" note that not all activities of private bodies are subject to private law; activities may be governed by public law standards when subject to duties conferred by statute or when a body is performing a function that carries public interest. However, not all decisions made during public functions are subject to judicial review, particularly when other branches of law or contracts govern the dispute. The case under consideration involves a private company engaged in cigarette manufacturing and sale, and it was argued that the company's canteen operation does not constitute a public function. Finally, the court addressed and rejected claims related to hazardous locations for the canteen and a fire incident

[Facts] The case involves disputes related to the compensation for land acquisition and auction of land owned by M/s. Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd (referred to as "the company"). The High Court ordered compensation payment based on a compromise between the state and the company. The state and the company both challenged this decision. The company also challenged an auction of its land, which was canceled by the High Court. The auction purchasers requested a refund, leading to a series of legal actions
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the case where a company had financial difficulties and a receiver was appointed by the District Collector. The company's sugar mill was later acquired by the state, and loans were provided by the state to facilitate its operations. However, the High Court failed to address the issue of remaining dues and liabilities of the company. The court found that the High Court wrongly declared certain orders as illegal. The court ruled that equitable grounds warranted interest on the refunded amount, given that the auction purchasers had deposited the full amount and the title had been transferred to them

[Facts] The manufacturer of the drug "Barlagan Ketone" reported its price to the central government in 1971. Following the Drugs Prices Control Order of 1979, which aimed to fix maximum prices for essential and non-essential bulk drugs, the manufacturer applied for a price of Rs 8,500 per kg. The central government issued notifications to fix maximum prices for various bulk drugs, including Barlagan Ketone, but these notifications were challenged and quashed by the Delhi High Court due to a lack of adherence to principles of natural justice. The High Court also quashed notifications fixing retail prices for drug formulations, which depend on bulk drug prices. The Union of India appealed against the High Court's judgment, presenting its case against the judgment, while the manufacturers were represented by their counsel
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving allegations of exploitation in the pharmaceutical market and high pricing by manufacturers of bulk drugs. It also clarifies that fairness doesn't require giving manufacturers an opportunity in the price fixation process, as the primary focus is on consumers' interests. The text also discusses the distinction between essential bulk drugs and the price control measures associated with them. The text emphasizes the legislative nature of price fixation and the government's role in securing fair prices for consumers. It argues that the focus should be on the interests of the consumer public rather than manufacturers

[Facts] The accused, Pathan Hussain Basha, was married to Pathan Haseena Begum, now deceased, in an arranged marriage. A dowry of Rs 25,000 was promised, of which Rs 15,000 was paid initially, and the remaining Rs 10,000 was to be paid later. Due to non-payment, the accused and his family harassed and subjected the deceased to cruelty. The parents of the deceased found her hanging, untied her, and took her to the hospital, but she was declared dead. The accused were arrested, faced trial, and were convicted for offenses under IPC Sections 498A and 304B. They were sentenced to imprisonment and fines
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the evidence presented by the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused in relation to charges under Sections 498A and 304B of the IPC. The prosecution established that the deceased died by hanging and that she had informed her family about the harassment. The court clarified the meaning of terms like "dowry death," "soon before her death," and "in connection with any demand for dowry." Therefore, the court decided to uphold the guilty verdict but reduce the sentences for the appellants. The court also noted that one of the accused had been acquitted by the high court and that the state did not challenge this acquittal

[Facts] This appeal concerns a property dispute involving various parties. Dwarka Nath Ghose owned properties and dedicated them to a family idol through a will. His son Rajendra confirmed this dedication and made his own will, appointing his brother Jogendra as executor. Jogendra died in 1911, and further complications arose, including mortgages and settlements. Eventually, the premises were sold in 1936 to the appellants
[Ratio of the decision] The main points of the court's decision are as follows: 1. The will explicitly dedicates the property to the deity and restricts the rights of any heirs or representatives to the property. The second contention regarding adverse possession by Nagendra is not upheld. Nagendra was a minor when a settlement was reached in 1910, and he was allowed to join as a sevayat upon reaching majority. In summary, the court upholds the dedication of the property to the deity and dismisses the argument of adverse possession by Nagendra due to his role as a shebait

[Facts] The case involves twelve accused individuals who were tried for various offenses, including murder, attempted murder, and terrorism charges under TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act) in Pune. Six of the accused were acquitted, while five appellants were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment along with fines for various charges. The incident began with a dispute at a video parlour, which escalated into a violent attack near a hotel and a math. The victims were assaulted with swords, satturs, and sticks. The accused were identified by several witnesses, and medical examinations confirmed injuries on the victims
[Ratio of the decision] The appellants have appealed their convictions and sentences under Section 19 of TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Prevention Act) after being found guilty in a case where a minor altercation escalated into the death of an individual and injuries to others. The incident involved an attack by the accused, armed with weapons, on the victims. The death of the victim and the injuries to others were established through medical evidence. However, doubts were raised about the involvement of a 10 due to inconsistencies in the testimonies. The court found that the charge under Section 3 of TADA was not established based on the facts of the case, as there was no evidence to show that the attack was intended to strike terror within a particular community

[Facts] This case involves the interpretation of Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. The first respondent filed a suit alleging infringement and sought an injunction. The first respondent filed an application for rectification, claiming that the appellant hadn't used the trademark for centrifugal pumps for more than five years, so it should be removed from the register. The appellant, however, obtained a certificate of registration for the trademark in question. The Intellectual Property Appellate Board dismissed the rectification application, while the High Court directed the board to adjudicate the dispute on its merits
[Ratio of the decision] The key issue in this case is the maintainability of an application under Section 46(1)(b) of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act. However, such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved. While trafficking in trade marks should be discouraged, proving speculative assignment requires a strong case. The Act's intention is not to create a "sunset law" but to determine the validity of trade mark rights on a case-by-case basis. In essence, the court's decision centers on the importance of ensuring a legitimate application of the law, preventing circumvention of the Act's provisions through speculative assignments, and upholding the rights of registered trade mark owners

[Facts] The case involves an appeal by the State of Manipur against a judgment and order passed by the Guwahati High Court. Mr. Tayeng allegedly made temporary appointments without the state's knowledge, leading to confusion about the validity of the appointments. Appointments were made for various positions on different dates in 1997. An inquiry was conducted to determine the issuing authority, during which Mr. Tayeng denied any knowledge of the appointments. Despite initially denying involvement in the appointments, he later affirmed in an affidavit that he had indeed issued appointment orders
[Ratio of the decision] The respondents in the case filed writ petitions before the High Court challenging the cancellation of their appointments. The court examined the matter in light of constitutional principles outlined in Articles 14 and 16 of the Indian Constitution. The appointments of the respondents were cancelled because they were deemed to be made without the knowledge of the Revenue Department and were considered invalid. The Court reasoned that if the appointment letters were fake documents, the State had no obligation to pay salaries based on them. Actions that violate the constitutional and legal framework cannot be considered binding on the State

[Facts] The appellant in this case was detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). He was the managing director of a company involved in exporting alloy steel products. The appellant was detained based on these allegations. Release of goods, documents, and contempt notice by civil courts. The crux was whether the withheld documents were material for the appellant's effective representation, as their non-supply could render the detention order invalid
[Ratio of the decision] In this legal case, the appellant's detention is being discussed. Several issues have been raised, including the failure to present important documents to the authority responsible for the detention, the delay in issuing the detention order, and doubts about the authority's proper consideration of the case. The appellant was eventually released from custody, and the court is examining the reasons for the delay. Despite some explanation for the delay, the court questions why the detention order took four months to be issued after the proposal for detention was made. The court also mentions that relevant documents, including statements of the appellant and another individual, were not provided to the detaining authority

[Facts] This is an appeal against a judgment by the Bombay High Court affirming the conviction of the appellants under Section 304 B read with Section 34 IPC. 1, and allegedly suffered harassment from the appellants related to dowry demands. Bhimabai complained about harassment and beatings by her husband and mother-in-law. Witnesses provide accounts of the ill-treatment Bhimabai faced. Post-mortem results suggest insecticide poisoning
[Ratio of the decision] The main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money, harassment, and beating towards Bhimabai are her parents, specifically PW1 Tukaram and PW5 Sumanbai. PW5 Sumanbai stated that Bhimabai faced ill treatment due to a "domestic cause" involving a demand for money. Notably, her statement under Section 161 Cr. The evidence doesn't establish the essential element of dowry demand as defined in the Dowry Prohibition Act. The appellants were also charged under Sections 498A and 306 read with Section 34 IPC but were acquitted, and these acquittals are final

[Facts] This appeal is based on the judgment and order dated 01-07-2002 passed by the Bombay High Court at Goa. The appellant was convicted under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sentenced to life imprisonment. They stabbed one Rauji Dulba Sawant, leading to his death, and assaulted other family members. The prosecution's case was that a heated exchange occurred during a religious ceremony, and this escalated into an assault involving the accused. The appellant, being aggrieved by his conviction, filed this appeal
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court reviews the facts to better understand the arguments presented by both parties. The dispute started over an electricity connection in the house. 3 to the hall, adding to the available light. 1 received simple injuries and the deceased suffered fatal stab injuries inflicted by the appellant. The court further examines the medical evidence, pointing out that although there were minor discrepancies between the ocular evidence and the postmortem report, the cause of death was established as a stab injury caused by the appellant

[Facts] In suit number 493 of 1986, filed in the Bombay City Civil Court by Vicco Laboratories against defendants 1 to 4, the appellant claimed exclusive rights to the title and content of the TV serial "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi." Vicco Laboratories, a manufacturer of Ayurvedic pharmaceutical products, alleged that they owned the title and episodes of the serial and sought a declaration and injunction against the defendants from using their material. They contended that the defendants were acting as their agents and therefore the serial belonged to them. The court found that the petitioners' involvement in the serial came after substantial work had already been done, and they had agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes while the defendants committed to producing 52 episodes. The court ruled that the petitioners did not prove their ownership claims, whether based on agency, sponsorship, or copyright, and therefore their appeal was dismissed
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's core principle lies in the understanding that copyright isn't attached to mere ideas but rather to the actual work produced. Particularly, the effect of Section 17 of the Copyright Act and whether the correspondence demonstrated ownership and copyright entitlement to the TV program "Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi." The findings from the trial court and the appellate court emphasized: 1. 2 as the producer, with the petitioners only being sponsors. As for the claim based on Section 17 of the Copyright Act, the respondents didn't create the serial as agents for the petitioners or at their instance, and thus, the issue of copyright ownership under Section 17(b) and (c) doesn't apply

[Facts] The Municipal Corporation of Delhi has appealed against a judgment dated March 26, 2004, by the Delhi High Court. The High Court granted probation under Section 4 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, to the second respondent, Gurcharan Singh, but upheld the conviction. The designated municipal court found the accused guilty, prompting an appeal to the Sessions Court and then a criminal revision petition before the High Court. Displeased with the High Court's decision, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. The Additional Sessions Judge also upheld the conviction and the sentence passed by the trial court
[Ratio of the decision] The court reviewed the case's documents and heard arguments from the involved parties. Two questions of law were raised: 1) Whether the High Court correctly extended the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, without seeking a conduct report on the accused, and 2) Whether the High Court's decision was correct considering the respondent's previous conviction. The court found that the respondent had withheld information about a previous conviction, which amounted to playing fraud on the court. This behavior disentitled the respondent from receiving any relief, and he was directed to pay a cost of Rs 10,000 to the appellant. The court emphasized that when exercising discretion under the Probation of Offenders Act, the circumstances of the case, nature of the offense, and character of the offender must be considered

[Facts] The case involves an appeal against the Madras High Court's decision to acquit the accused, who was originally convicted under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by a lower court. The appellant argued that the High Court overlooked the established chain of circumstances supporting the prosecution's case. It was noted that the initial investigating officer (PW 40) had made efforts to falsely implicate other individuals, including the victim's family members, and even initiated a departmental proceeding based on fabricated documents. The reliability of PW 40's evidence was questioned due to these actions. The summary highlights the background, circumstances, evidence, and the differing perspectives of the appellant and the respondent (accused) regarding the trial and appeal process
[Ratio of the decision] The decision emphasizes the principles of evaluating circumstantial evidence in a criminal case. The burden of proof lies with the party asserting the existence of a fact that implies legal accountability. The court underscores that the fact discovered must be relevant to the issue and connected with the crime, and the discovery must result from information given by the accused. Doubts about the voluntariness of confessions, the reliability of witnesses, and the inconsistency of evidence are pointed out. The summary focuses on the court's detailed analysis of the circumstantial evidence presented in the case and its subsequent endorsement of the High Court's decision to acquit the accused

[Facts] This case involves three appeals against an order from the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB), which ordered the removal of the "Infosys" trademark from the trade register. The appellant, Infosys Technologies Limited, had registered the mark for computer-related goods and services. Infosys Technologies Limited filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court in 1992, seeking to prevent Jupiter Infosys Limited from using the term. Jupiter Infosys Limited filed applications before the Madras High Court under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act 1958 (1958 Act) for removal and rectification of registered trademarks. Both parties' arguments were presented to the court
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court considered the question of whether the first respondent, Jupiter Infosys Limited, was an "aggrieved person" with the standing to apply for the removal and rectification of the "Infosys" trademark registered by the appellant, Infosys Technologies Limited. The court determined that to be considered an "aggrieved person," the applicant's interest must be affected in some practical way, and there must be a likelihood of injury or damage if the trademark remains on the register. Sections 46 and 56 both require the applicant to be "aggrieved" to apply for removal or rectification of a trademark. However, the interpretation of "aggrieved person" differs between these sections. The court refrained from delving into the merits of the diverse arguments presented and left it to the parties to present their contentions before the IPAB

[Facts] This appeal arises from a judgment and order of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dated April 15, 1986. In 1948, the ruler of Mukkalla state, Sail Nawaz Jung, settled some properties in favor of his son Sultan Awaz and grandson Galib Bin Awaz. The property was requisitioned by the government in 1963. The issue went to an arbitrator, who eventually ruled in Abdul Khader's favor. Ultimately, the high court ruled that Abdul Khader was indeed a protected tenant and entitled to compensation for the acquired property
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue is whether the high court was correct in upholding the arbitrator's award in favor of Abdul Khader, entitling him to 60% of the compensation for the acquired land. However, the court disagrees, stating that the central act mandates compensation to individuals with an interest in the acquired land. Section 102 of the Andhra Pradesh Act specifies that the Act does not apply after land is acquired. The court affirms that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to determine Abdul Khader's compensation based on his interests in the property. This was consistent with previous court orders that left the decision of his protected tenancy status open for determination

[Facts] In the case, a series of orders and directions were issued by the court regarding admissions to educational institutions for different academic sessions. A constitution bench categorized various writ petitions challenging these orders into different groups based on the nature of the institutions and the issues involved. The court stated that this was a one-time provision for that year. The admissions for these institutions were directed to be made according to the terms of agreements with the government of Kerala. For the next academic session, the court directed that admissions in institutions claimed to be minority educational institutions would follow the previously given directions, with some exceptions for institutions governed by agreements with state governments
[Ratio of the decision] In this case concerning admissions to professional courses in various educational institutions claiming minority status, the court reframed questions for consideration. The court acknowledged the importance of clarifying the terms "minority" and "minority educational institution." An interim order was issued for the upcoming academic session, assuming that the petitioners were minority institutions. Institutions in Kerala that were governed by agreements with the government were required to follow those agreements for admissions. The management of the institution was allowed to judge the merit of candidates

[Facts] In this case, Lakshminarayana Iyer, a Hindu Brahmin, owned properties and passed away in 1924, leaving behind his widow Ranganayaki and married daughter Ramalakshmi. Ranganayaki obtained possession of the properties upon her husband's death. Ramalakshmi passed away in 1938, and no children survived her. Ranganayaki sold one property in 1945, leading the plaintiff (Ramalakshmi's husband and sole heir) to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration that the sale wouldn't bind him beyond Ranganayaki's lifetime. The plaintiff amended the suit to challenge these alienations
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue revolves around whether the estate granted by the testator in his will was a full woman's estate under Hindu law or a limited life estate in the English sense. It is established that a Hindu can create various types of estates through a will, including life estates or limited term estates, provided the recipients are capable of inheriting through a deed or will. The court cited various cases and discussions presented by both sides, highlighting differences in will language, intention, and surrounding circumstances. Ultimately, the court determined that the testator intended to grant the widow a limited life estate rather than a full Hindu widow's estate. The decision underscores the importance of interpreting a will's language within its context and the testator's intentions, and how the nature of the estate granted can vary depending on these factors

[Facts] This appeal involves a dispute over land ownership and compensation for improvements. The land's ownership was disputed between an illom (family) and the state. The appellant believed the land belonged to the illom and had occupied it, making various improvements. The appellant's claim was rejected based on these considerations. In summary, the appeal involves a dispute over land ownership and compensation for improvements made by the appellant, who was eventually dispossessed from the land
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant's argument is that even after the Act was passed, unauthorized occupants of government land who made improvements had a preferential claim for assignment of the land they occupied. The appellant's claim was decreed for the value of his bungalow, but not for other improvements. Therefore, he was not a bona fide trespasser. The appellant argued he was entitled to compensation for trees due to his intention to improve the land, but the court rejected this argument, stating that it would encourage wrongful trespassing. The court held that the appellant's claim for compensation was invalid, as he was not a bona fide trespasser and trees could not be considered "other product raised on the land" under the Act

[Facts] Three civil appeals have been brought to the Supreme Court arising from three revision petitions to the High Court of Orissa under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951 (Orissa Act I of 1952). The dispute concerns the compensation he received, and the case has gone through various stages of adjudication. The compensation officer's initial decision was unfavorable to the appellant, leading to an appeal to the Collector, which was also rejected. The appellant then appealed to the Board of Revenue without success. The compensation officer was to decide the case within six months
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central issue revolves around the quantum of compensation under the Orissa Estates Abolition Act, 1951. The appellant, Shri Achutananda Purohit, challenged the compensation he received for his estate, which vested in the state in 1960. He raised nine contentions, each of which the court considered and rejected. It also highlighted that challenges to compensation amounts based on social transformation were not valid due to constitutional provisions. The integrated process, as described by the court, was essential for determining compensation
