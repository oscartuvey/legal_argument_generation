[Facts] In this case, the appellant is a public limited company that manufactures switchboards. The registered trade union of the company's workers filed a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act against the company, alleging that the trainee program was an unfair labor practice, as it intended to replace workmen's tasks with newly trained officers. However, the court rejected these arguments. It also clarified that the case involving the termination of another employee, Govind Raj, was not relevant to the issues at hand. Ultimately, the court upheld the findings that the company's actions amounted to unfair labor practices and that the officer trainee program breached the settlement agreement
[Ratio of the decision] The court's decision in this case revolves around the concept of unfair labor practices and the interpretation of a settlement agreement. It emphasized that the union's claims of unfair labor practice needed to be specific and substantiated, especially given the changing circumstances. The court highlighted the need for a harmonious interpretation of the settlement agreement's clauses and underscored that the company had the right to rearrange its business and offer promotions to workmen without violating the agreement. The court emphasized that the key was not to create discord among workmen or undermine the union's strength. It concluded that the union's claims lacked merit and allowed the appeal while clarifying that the company should implement the promotion scheme without causing retrenchment or rendering workmen surplus

[Facts] The applicants raised allegations about a park project's environmental impact. The park was built near a bird sanctuary, and the applicants claimed harm to the sanctuary. The project involved cutting down trees and constructing various features. The project involved setting up a recreational park near the Yamuna River. The court directed the MoEF to assess the environmental impact and suggest mitigation measures
[Ratio of the decision] The text discusses a legal case involving a project located near the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. It noted that while the project area had a significant tree cover, it did not fit the criteria for a forest or forest-like area as per the guidelines and definitions. The court emphasized that context matters in defining such terms and clarified that not all tree-covered areas would qualify as forests. Therefore, it did not require prior environmental clearance under the Forest Conservation Act or the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of 2006. The court's judgment emphasized the categorization of the project

[Facts] The case involves an appellant dissatisfied with a 2005 judgment from the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The appellant filed a civil suit in 1985 against the first respondent, who did not appear, leading to an ex parte decree. A mutation application was later approved based on this decree. After learning of the decree in 1997, the first respondent sought to set it aside. The High Court claimed that the appellant had fraudulently obtained the ex parte decree due to improper summons service
[Ratio of the decision] The decision states that the delay in filing the application to set aside the decree is not acceptable. The first respondent was aware of the decree's existence, as indicated by their conversations with relatives. Since they could have filed the application within one month of the decree, the delay cannot be excused. Therefore, the application is time-barred, and the High Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it. The decision favors the respondents (plaintiffs) and upholds the time limitation principle

[Facts] The case involves Swami Vivekanand College of Education challenging regulations imposed by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) regarding teacher training courses. The appellants initially sought permission to increase student intake without proper accreditation, but the NCTE introduced regulations in 2007 requiring accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with a letter grade B. The appellants contested these regulations in court. The Delhi High Court upheld the validity of the regulations. During the appeal, the NCTE introduced new regulations in 2009 with similar requirements. The case raises questions about the authority and accountability of recognized institutions and the standards for teacher education
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the validity of regulations 8.4 and 8.5 of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), challenged by Swami Vivekanand College of Education. The appellants argued that these regulations violated their rights and were retrospective. The court ruled that regulation 8.4 is a condition for opening new courses or enhancing intake, not sub-delegation. Regulation 8.5 was found to be prospective, not retrospective, and therefore, did not infringe on rights. The court emphasized the authority of the NCTE to set conditions for recognition and found the regulations valid, not arbitrary

[Facts] The case involves legal heirs seeking permission to retain a shop originally allotted to their predecessor. The key question is whether the heirs can keep the shop if they pay the unpaid amount to the authority. Despite orders to pay the unpaid amount with interest, the full sum hasn't been paid yet. If not paid by the specified date, the heirs risk losing the shop. The case involves legal proceedings in New Delhi and pertains to liiofindia's copyright policy, disclaimers, and privacy policy
[Ratio of the decision] The respondent authority has informed the appellants about the total payable amount. If the appellants pay Rs 3,90,000 within the given period, the authority will complete the allotment formalities. Failure to pay will result in the shop's possession being handed back to the authority. This order is specific to the present case and not intended as a precedent

[Facts] The case involves the interpretation of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (I.D. Act). A complaint was filed by the Deputy Labour Commissioner in Patna, seeking the appellant's prosecution under Section 25U read with Section 29 of the I.D. Act. The appellant challenged this by filing a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. The High Court dismissed the petition, affirming the complaint's maintainability. The central issue revolves around the interpretation and effect of the recommendations made in the Annexure P1 notification
[Ratio of the decision] The case involves the application of the Industrial Disputes Act (I.D. Act) and the Working Journalists Act. The court considers the jurisdiction to proceed under the I.D. Act and the applicability of the Working Journalists Act. It is noted that the recommendations of the Wage Board are in the form of suggestions and do not amount to an award. The court emphasizes that if a dispute arises regarding the amount due under the recommendations and an award is passed by the labor court, failure to implement this award can lead to prosecution under Section 25U of the I.D. Act. The court allows the appeal, quashes the impugned order, and directs the labor court to expedite the disposal of the pending case reference

[Facts] The case involves a dispute concerning the release of a vehicle seized in connection with an offense under the Delhi Excise Act, 2009. The vehicle was found carrying illegal liquor. The respondent, claiming to be the owner of the vehicle, filed applications for its release on security, which were rejected by the lower courts. The respondent, on the other hand, contends that the High Court has the jurisdiction to pass such an order. The case involves complex legal arguments about the jurisdiction of the High Court and the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Delhi Excise Act
[Ratio of the decision] The case concerns the release of a seized vehicle involved in an offense under the Delhi Excise Act, 2009. The High Court had ordered the release of the vehicle based on Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). However, the Supreme Court analyzed the provisions of the Delhi Excise Act and concluded that the Act's scheme mandates that the vehicle seized under the Act must be produced before the Deputy Commissioner, who has the authority to decide its confiscation or release. The Court held that the special provisions of the Act override the general provisions of CrPC, and therefore the Magistrate or High Court has no jurisdiction to order the interim custody or release of the seized vehicle under CrPC. The Court clarified that the challenge to the vires of the provisions of the Act was not raised in this case

[Facts] The case involves a husband's challenge to the maintenance order for his wife and alleged daughter. The husband denied this and sought a DNA test for paternity. The court ordered the test, which excluded the husband as the biological father. A second test at a different laboratory produced similar results. The husband appealed, contesting his paternity
[Ratio of the decision] The case involves a dispute over the paternity of a child for maintenance purposes. The husband challenged the maintenance order and requested a DNA test, which indicated he was not the biological father. The court ordered a retest, but both tests upheld the conclusion. The wife relied on Section 112 of the Evidence Act, which states that if a child is born during the marriage, the husband is deemed to be the father. It concluded that the husband's lack of access to the wife during the conception period was established by the DNA test results and upheld the notion that the truth must be upheld, denying the presumption of paternity in this case

[Facts] The case involves appeals against a Delhi High Court judgment concerning the denial of concessional postage rates for magazines by the Postal Department. The Postal Department denied concessional postage for magazines containing advertisements and booklets, as they were not considered part of the publication. The Postal Department's appeals were dismissed by the High Court's Division Bench. The Postal Department appeals to the Supreme Court, seeking Special Leave to Appeal (SLP) against the High Court's decision. The officer's explanation for the delay was considered inadequate
[Ratio of the decision] The case involves the consideration of several issues, including whether the delay in filing Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) by the Postal Department can be condoned, whether an impugned advertisement in a magazine conforms to legal requirements, and whether the department has grounds to challenge concurrent findings of fact by the High Court. The Postal Department sought to condone a delay of 427 days in filing the SLPs, and the court considered the reasons provided for the delay. The court examined the reasons provided by the Postal Department for the delay, including administrative procedures and changes in government personnel. It noted that delay cannot be condoned mechanically just because a government department is involved, and that a liberal approach must still be grounded in substantial justice. The other issues in the case were left open for future consideration

[Facts] This legal case involves a second appeal (No. In 1950, the trial court deemed notice unnecessary for lease termination and denied relief. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was granted concerning Survey No. Principle under consideration: The court considered the principle that a lessor must show an intention to determine the lease by some act indicating that intention. Note: This summary provides an overview of the key events, legal issues, and court decisions in the case
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the central legal issue revolves around whether a notice in writing by the lessor is necessary to terminate a lease due to non-payment of rent, as required by Section 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The statute requires notice in writing by the lessor to determine a lease for non-payment of rent, even for leases executed before the Act came into force. The Court criticizes the reliance on a prior case that suggested a suit for ejectment alone should suffice. The Court suggests that interference with the discretion exercised by the lower courts would not be appropriate. The Court upholds the requirement for notice in writing and declines to interfere with the lower courts' decisions
