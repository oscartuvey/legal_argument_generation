[Facts] Tata Consultancy Engineers filed an appeal against a 1978 award by the Industrial Tribunal in Maharashtra, which revised wage scales and benefits for certain employee categories. The company's workforce included engineers, supervisors, and various workmen categories. The tribunal recognized the need for revising wage scales due to the company's increased paying capacity over the years. The Tata Consultancy Employees Union appealed against the rejection of their demand to link dearness allowance to the cost of living index. The union argued that the company could bear the additional financial burden, citing evidence from the company's documents
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving Tata Consultancy Engineers and their employees' union, revolving around wage scale revisions and dearness allowance. There appears to be a clerical error in the original award, which led to a misunderstanding regarding the inclusion of a flat increase in employees' pay. The tribunal's original intention was to revise wage scales, integrate flat increases into those scales, and not provide separate ad hoc increases to individual employees. The employees sought to correct this by filing an application under rule 31 to clarify the award's intent. Ultimately, the court dismisses the appeals, upholding the tribunal's decision

[Facts] The passage discusses two appeals with identical questions regarding the legality of withdrawing benefits as subsidies. The case involves the principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation. The appellants argue that the High Court erred by not considering their counterarguments, presenting undisclosed materials, and violating natural justice. The subsidies were concessions that could be modified in public interest. The core challenge revolves around the accuracy of these factual conclusions
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses the legal principles related to vested rights, legitimate expectations, policy changes, arbitrariness, and executive actions. It emphasizes that concessions don't confer vested rights, and promissory estoppel applies when industry relies on government representation. Legitimate expectations arise from representations or past practice, but are limited by public interest and legal boundaries. Article 14 requires fair and non-arbitrary policy changes, and the concept of arbitrariness is context-dependent. The passage concludes that the High Court's decision wasn't tenable, and that the legality of retrospective withdrawal needs further examination by the court

[Facts] The appeals are against a judgment from a special court regarding transactions in securities. The appellants are related to Harshad S. Mehta and own flats in Mumbai. The appellants and Harshad Mehta were notified under the Securities Act. The custodian sought permission to sell certain properties, while the appellants sought the release of their properties. The appellants had earlier applied for de-notification, but withdrew them
[Ratio of the decision] The case pertains to the application of a law that provides strict measures for dealing with individuals involved in securities-related offenses. The right of notified individuals to challenge their liability or property attachment can be raised early on or when liabilities need to be discharged. Both parties have raised various contentions not previously raised in court. The appellants argue their properties should only be attached for liabilities during the statutory period. The court must consider if the defense arguments can be raised and whether assets and liabilities should be treated separately

[Facts] Three appeals have been filed against a Kolkata High Court judgment dated 25th September 1992. The dispute revolves around Nalban Fishery, involving the Sarkar family in Kolkata. A partition suit was filed in 1955 regarding this fishery. The state took possession, and the Sarkar family challenged the requisition in court. Various legal actions were taken, including appeals and a writ petition
[Ratio of the decision] The Calcutta High Court, both the learned single judge and the division bench, made a serious legal mistake by ordering the receiver to take possession of Nalban Fishery from the State of West Bengal and deliver it to the Sarkar family members. The subsequent receiver, who took over the role of district magistrate, had no authority to re-deliver possession of Nalban Fishery to the state, and the subsequent receiver's actions showed bias. The State of West Bengal had not been bound by the earlier compromise decree regarding the fishery. The special leave petition's dismissal affirmed the state's legal requisition of Nalban Fishery since 1969. The impact of the amendment to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act in 1986 was also examined

[Facts] Yakshagana is a traditional ballet dance form with a unique heritage. After Dr. Karanth's passing, a performance of his developed Yakshagana took place in New Delhi in 2001. The respondent filed a suit claiming copyright infringement in relation to the dance, asserting rights from the will. She alleged that Dr. Karanth had developed a distinctive form named "Yaksha Ranga," a creative extension of traditional Yakshagana, and the appellants' performance in New Delhi without her permission violated her copyright. The lower courts sided with the respondent, affirming her exclusive copyright and issuing injunctions against the defendants' performances
[Ratio of the decision] The court discusses the issues raised in the case related to copyright infringement of Yakshagana performances. It notes that while dramatic literature can be considered a form of literary work, the copyright provisions of the act differentiate between "literary work" and "dramatic work." However, this distinction doesn't mean that the provisions of the will dated 18/6/1994 are not applicable; they still apply in relevant areas. Thus, if the performances fall under the scope of these clauses, the injunction order does not apply. Additionally, if performances are carried out by an educational institution or before a non-paying audience by an amateur club or society, they may not violate the injunction order

[Facts] The appellant claimed to be a tenant of two adjacent premises, while the respondent was the landlord. The respondent alleged that the appellant had closed his business and unlawfully sublet the premises to a partnership firm named "Bharat Neon Signs," of which the appellant was also a partner. Over time, the partnership firm underwent changes in its composition. The appellant's subletting to the partnership firm was alleged. The lower court and an appeal court decreed in favor of the landlord, dissolving the partnership
[Ratio of the decision] The central issue in this appeal is whether the appellant and his father had sublet the premises in question in accordance with Section 13(1)(e) of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (referred to as the "Rent Act"). The matter involves interpreting the scope of Section 29(2) of the Rent Act. The appellant and his father were alleged to have formed a partnership with others to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling neon signs tubes. The court emphasized that a partnership involves an agreement to share profits and the carrying on of business by all or any of the partners acting for all. The court upheld the lower court's decision that the appellant had not sublet the premises, and the partnership did not lead to forfeiture of the tenancy

[Facts] This appeal challenges a judgment from the High Court of Andhra Pradesh dated October 3, 2007, where the appellant's appeal was dismissed and the conviction imposed by the Special Judge for CBI Cases was upheld. The appellant, who worked as a head clerk in the South Central Railway, was convicted of corruption charges involving the acceptance of a bribe. The complainant, a railway employee seeking a transfer, reported to the CBI that the appellant had demanded a bribe of Rs 200 for processing his transfer request. The High Court upheld this conviction and sentence. The matter before the Supreme Court was limited to the quantum of sentence
[Ratio of the decision] The decision clarifies that when a notice is issued confining arguments to a specific aspect (in this case, the quantum of sentence), the parties are not entitled to raise all points and reopen the case without restriction. The judgment emphasizes that the court will not ignore statutory provisions or act merely out of sympathy under Article 142 of the Constitution. It highlighted that when the statute prescribes a minimum sentence, delay may not be a valid ground for sentence reduction. The court also emphasized that Article 142's power cannot supplant or ignore substantive provisions of the relevant statute, ensuring consistency with both constitutional rights and statutory laws. The appellant's bail bonds were cancelled

[Facts] This appeal challenges a judgment from the Punjab and Haryana High Court dated August 19, 2011. The incident occurred on November 18, 1994, when a confrontation arose between the complainant, his sons, and the accused. The prosecution's case relied on circumstantial evidence and medical testimony. The accused claimed self-defense and denied their involvement. The injured party was severely wounded, including a head injury
[Ratio of the decision] The court carefully considered the contentions and reviewed the evidence in the case. The injuries were corroborated by medical evidence and the testimony of the injured witnesses. Rajbir was sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment, but considering the circumstances, the court reduced the sentence to three years. Thus, their sentences were reduced to the period already served. The court took into account the nature of injuries, the passage of time since the incident, and the overall circumstances in determining the appropriate sentences and compensation in this case

[Facts] This special leave appeal arises from a Bombay High Court judgment dated March 1, 2005. The charter party agreement was initially set to end on August 31, 1998. The High Court emphasized that the vessel had not been redelivered as per the charter party's terms, and therefore, the original agreement was still in effect. The court held that the tribunal had misinterpreted certain clauses of the charter party agreement and that it did indeed have jurisdiction to decide the dispute. The High Court found that the agreement had continued in effect, except for the hire rates, and thus the arbitral tribunal had jurisdiction to decide the matter
[Ratio of the decision] The text examines legal questions in a vessel charter agreement dispute. Another issue is whether the charter party dated May 6, 1997, ended naturally on August 30, 1998. The appeal questions the correctness of a High Court order. The principle of "sub silentio" is discussed, suggesting that conduct can imply agreement even without explicit words. The arbitral tribunal's decision on the vessel's non-delivery and the application of charter party clauses is critiqued for not considering this aspect as part of the arbitration agreement

[Facts] The matter involves confusion stemming from the postponed commencement of the Patents Amendment Act 2005. In 2002, the legislature aimed to create an appellate forum for patent-related appeals. The Patents Amendment Act 2002 was enacted but not immediately enforced. Despite these changes, certain sections were not enforced simultaneously. The case highlights the complexity resulting from amendments and delayed enforcement of different sections of patent-related legislation
[Ratio of the decision] The case revolves around the introduction of a dichotomy in patent law by the Patents Amendment Act 2005, separating opposition to pre-grant and post-grant patents. However, the enactment of certain sections, including Section 117a, was delayed. In the context of these complexities, the court determined that the appeals filed prior to the enforcement of the new law, under the old provisions, should be heard and decided by the High Court. The Appellate Board, with jurisdiction over post-grant matters, couldn't consider these appeals. This case highlights the challenges arising from delayed enforcement and the resultant impact on legal proceedings

[Facts] An FIR was filed based on the statement of Prakashi Devi, who claimed that the appellant trespassed her house, broke bulbs, and later touched her daughter-in-law, Sheela Devi. The police filed a report, and charges were framed against the appellant for house trespass and assault with intent to outrage modesty. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The defense argued that the charge didn't match the evidence, but the courts rejected this technicality, stating an error in naming Prakashi Devi instead of Sheela Devi in the charge wasn't prejudicial and upheld the conviction. The case centers on allegations of trespass, assault, and modesty outrage
[Ratio of the decision] The central issue is whether an accused can be convicted for an offense against a person (Y) when the charge is framed for an offense against a different person (X), even if the error in the charge did not prejudice the accused or lead to a failure of justice. Prejudice and Failure of Justice: If an accused is charged with an offense against person X but is convicted based on evidence related to person Y without a charge against person Y, this can prejudice the accused and result in a failure of justice. However, if the accused was aware of the error and defended themselves against the actual offense charged, there might not be prejudice. Substance Over Technicalities: Courts should prioritize the substance of the case over technicalities. Informed Defense: If the accused concentrated their defense on disproving the charges as framed, without trying to challenge evidence related to the actual offense committed, it indicates that they were defending against the actual charge and not the erroneous one

[Facts] This case involves a dispute over the payment of bonus to workers. Despite the loss, the company paid a dividend to shareholders and an ex gratia bonus to workers at a reduced rate. The workers' union sought a higher bonus rate through conciliation and legal proceedings. However, the labor appellate tribunal, while agreeing with the loss assessment, deemed this a special case of social justice. The tribunal did not establish a link between bonus and dividends or claim that the workers had any rights to the company's reserves or undistributed profits
[Ratio of the decision] The main question is whether workers are entitled to a bonus even when the employer faced a trading loss in the given year, and whether workers have any rights to company reserves and undistributed profits. The demand for bonus becomes an industrial claim under certain conditions, such as when wages are below living standards and the industry earns substantial profits. Bonus is not a deferred wage and cannot be claimed during a year of trading loss. The workers have no legal right to company reserves or undistributed profits. Such claims would not survive as labor forces change yearly

[Facts] This case involves appeals by four accused individuals who were convicted of murder. Dr. Shardha Prasad Tripathi, the husband of one of the accused, lodged a First Information Report (FIR) upon discovering the crime scene. Bhavna's body displayed multiple incised wounds. An eyewitness, Anil Kumar, testified that the accused attacked Bhavna, leading to her death. The accused were found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life imprisonment
[Ratio of the decision] The court carefully examined the identification process and the boy's testimony in a case involving a murder. The boy, Anil Kumar, identified the accused individuals accurately despite not knowing them previously. This identification was crucial as the boy had no motive to falsely implicate anyone. The court also discussed the need for corroboration of witness testimony but found the boy's identification reliable and specific. The court rejected appeals to previous cases and emphasized that common intention and conspiracy are inferred matters

[Facts] The appellants have appealed against a judgment of the High Court dated 25th November 2009 in relation to the acquisition of their agricultural lands by the State of Uttar Pradesh for building the Shahjahanpur district jail. The state government formed a committee to recommend the relocation of congested district jails to less populated areas. The old district jail in Shahjahanpur was overcrowded, and the committee proposed shifting it to new premises. The committee recommended land acquisition for the new jail premises and the preparation of a detailed project report. The district magistrate forwarded the proposal for land acquisition to the state government, which issued notifications under the Land Acquisition Act on 21st August 2008 without conducting a Section 5A inquiry due to urgency
[Ratio of the decision] The appellants presented several arguments before the court. The court found merit in the appellants' arguments. The court discussed the principles surrounding land acquisition, emphasizing that the Land Acquisition Act is a drastic law with expropriatory implications, and the concept of public purpose in acquisition must align with the principles of a welfare state. The court noted that the definition of public purpose has evolved over time and must be in harmony with constitutional values, especially fundamental rights and directive principles. The court discussed the scope of a person's right under Section 5A of the Act, which provides for a hearing in cases of urgency

[Facts] The appellants, who were engaged in biscuit manufacturing, appealed against the Customs Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal (CEGAT) decision dated 11th April 2000. Ltd., which had the registered trademark for "Meghraj" on its own products. The appellants appealed to the Commissioner and subsequently to CEGAT. The Commissioner and CEGAT rejected the appeals, holding that the appellants were using the trade name "Meghraj" on their products, which was owned by Kay Aar Biscuits. The appellants later sought rectification, arguing that the trade name "Meghraj" did not belong to Kay Aar Biscuits and that the department failed to prove it
[Ratio of the decision] The judgment outlines the reasons for rejecting the appellants' arguments and upholding the decisions of the lower authorities. The registration certificate for the "Meghraj" trademark was issued to the appellants on 30th June 2000 with retrospective effect from 30th September 1991. The registration under the Trade Marks Act doesn't necessarily grant exemption benefits in the context of excise law. The objective of the exemption notification was to provide benefits to small-scale industries (SSIs) without established brand names. Overall, the court found no merit in the appeals and upheld the decisions of the lower authorities

[Facts] This appeal is filed against the order of the Bombay High Court, which dismissed the appellant's Letter Patents Appeal. The properties in question originally belonged to Haji Habib Tar Mohammed Janu, who later sold them to Smt. Subsequent transactions and legal proceedings resulted in conflicting claims over the properties. Ultimately, the State Minister for Revenue reinstated the entries in favor of the respondents, leading to the appellant challenging this decision in the Bombay High Court. The appellant's writ petition and subsequent Letters Patent Appeal were both dismissed
[Ratio of the decision] The key legal question in this case is whether a second revision under Section 257 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code is permissible and whether the state government has the authority to entertain such a second revision. Even though there are provisions allowing certain revenue officers to exercise revisional powers, the state government's power to review decisions, including those made by other revenue officers, is preserved. This means that even if one party approaches a revenue officer for revision, the state government can still be approached for a separate revision. This authority allows the state government to ensure the legality and propriety of orders passed by various revenue officers. In summary, the court held that under the scheme of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, both the state government and certain revenue officers have the authority to exercise revisional powers

[Facts] The respondent worked as a technical assistant with the Gujarat State Electricity Board. He was promoted to deputy engineer and transferred to Ukai subdivision. However, the respondent later failed to appear before the court, so the court proceeded to decide the case. The respondent was transferred to Ukai and was relieved from his previous duties on March 30, 1974. He made a representation against the transfer, which was rejected, and he was directed to obey it
[Ratio of the decision] The appeal challenges the judgment and order of the High Court that allowed the respondent's writ petition, quashed his discharge order from service, and directed his reinstatement. The respondent misused adjournments to raise frivolous objections for transferring the case to another bench. Transfer of a government servant is an incident of service and a condition of employment. The respondent was transferred several times during his tenure. The Division Bench's finding that the letter of April 24, 1974, was raised for the first time is incorrect, and the respondent failed to rebut the presumption of service when a registered letter is returned with an endorsement of refusal

[Facts] In 1962, the Ministry of Defence acquired land for expanding the Sirsa airfield due to the Chinese invasion. The appellant, Major Som Nath, was accused of permitting the misappropriation of standing crops from the acquired land and accepting an illegal gratification of Rs. A case was registered against him under corruption charges. He appealed to the High Court, which upheld the conviction. The appellant's actions were considered offenses under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code
[Ratio of the decision] This appeal is against the conviction of the accused under Section 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court examines the order of sanction and concludes that the facts mentioned in it are sufficient to sustain the sanction under Section 5(1)(c). The court finds that the trial court and the high court's assessment of evidence is justified, and the appellant's denial of the existence of standing crops contradicts credible documentary evidence. The appellant's argument about witnesses not being called is dismissed as the prosecution had already provided evidence to establish its claims. In summary, the court addresses the appellant's challenges regarding the sanction and evidence, ultimately upholding the conviction

[Facts] This appeal arises from a case involving the interpretation of phrases in the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. The labor court ruled in her favor, but the establishment appealed to the High Court. The single judge sided with Subbammal, determining that the 12-week period referred to 12 weeks of work. The establishment now appeals to the Supreme Court. The question revolves around whether the 12-week period in the Act refers to actual working weeks or simply a continuous 12-week period
[Ratio of the decision] In the case of Cochin v. [Case Name], the key question was the interpretation of the term "week" in relation to the Maternity Benefits Act. The Act provided maternity benefits to women workers for a maximum of twelve weeks, split into prenatal and postnatal periods. The court examined various dictionary definitions and concluded that in the context of the Act, "week" should be understood as a cycle of seven days, including Sundays. The term "period" in the Act was seen as emphasizing continuous time and the recurrence of the seven-day cycle. In light of this reasoning, the court rejected a previous ruling by the Kerala High Court that held a contrary view

[Facts] The appeals under consideration stem from a shared judgment dated April 26, 2000, issued by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench, pertaining to similar legal and factual questions. Appellants 1 and 2 possess civil engineering degrees, while appellants 3 and 4 hold diplomas in civil engineering. The appellants were subsequently appointed and assigned to the "Indore Habitat Project," managed by the Overseas Development Authority (ODA), on daily wages. The matter was referred to the Labour Court in Indore by the Madhya Pradesh government for resolution. Based on the evidence and arguments presented, the Labour Court determined that the appellants' work was satisfactory and comparable to employees of the Indore Development Authority
[Ratio of the decision] The dispute in this case centered around whether the appellants' services were employed for the stated project or for the respondent authority. 14 and 16) in its appointments as a state entity. The respondent failed to follow statutory procedures for recruitment, rendering the appointments void. The court also noted that the nature of their engagement did not fulfill the conditions for permanent or temporary employment. The court further stated that the doctrine of "equal pay for equal work" could not apply to daily wage employees without sanctioned posts

[Facts] The appellant, Ujjagar Singh, was convicted for the murder of his niece, Mukhtiar Kaur, and sentenced to death, along with additional convictions for offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused was accused of killing Mukhtiar Kaur and attempting suicide. She had alleged that the land was fraudulently transferred from her mother. During the trial, several witnesses changed their statements or turned hostile. The appellant claimed innocence, stating that he was falsely implicated and had a fatherly relationship with Mukhtiar Kaur
[Ratio of the decision] The court reviewed the evidence and arguments presented in the case. The court noted that there was no physical evidence of rape or injuries indicative of sexual assault. While the appellant argued that there was no motive for the crime, the court stated that absence of motive alone does not necessarily disprove the prosecution's case. The court concluded that the appellant's claim that unknown assailants were responsible for the crime was not credible. In relation to the sentence, the court noted that the allegation of rape had not been substantiated, which led them to conclude that the death sentence was not warranted

[Facts] The appellants claimed to be tenants of agricultural land and filed a declaration seeking occupancy rights in the land. The case went through various legal proceedings, including a writ petition, an appeal, and a revision petition. The Appellate Authority also upheld this decision. However, the respondent filed a revision petition in the High Court, which overturned the previous decisions. In summary, the appellants' claim for occupancy rights was rejected by the High Court due to lack of sufficient evidence to establish their tenancy status as required by the Karnataka Land Reforms Act
[Ratio of the decision] The High Court had set aside the concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the lower tribunals under the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1974. Despite the High Court's exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section 121A of the Act, it's deemed inappropriate for the Supreme Court, using its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution, to interfere with this decision. After reviewing the appellants' and respondents' arguments, as well as examining the impugned judgment of the High Court and the lower tribunals' orders, the Supreme Court concluded that the High Court's decision was justified. The High Court was empowered by Section 121A of the Act to reevaluate evidence, examine legality, and determine regularity of proceedings. It declined to interfere using its powers under Article 136 of the Constitution

[Facts] The appellant was a tenant under respondent no. A road widening project was proposed, leading to the acquisition of 867 sq m of land for the public purpose. The remaining 200 sq m of land was subject to proceedings for re-allotment under the Act. The scheme was notified in 1999, and the municipal corporation issued notices to vacate. The appellant challenged the notices, claiming lack of proper notice issuance for allotment and demolition
[Ratio of the decision] The case revolves around the interpretation and application of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act 1976 and the related rules. 4, was affected by a road widening project. Notices were issued, and land was acquired for the public purpose, leaving only a smaller portion. The court concludes that the appellant's conduct constitutes waiver and estoppel against asserting his rights at this point, as the benefit of the notice provisions was for his benefit alone and not related to public interests. Therefore, he cannot claim equitable relief now

[Facts] The case concerns the grant of a proprietary jagir to the respondent by various hajur orders in the early 20th century. The respondent then sought to assert his rights to quarry gravel and stones in certain villages through applications and entries in revenue records. The dispute reached the Gujarat High Court through a writ petition. The case revolves around the question of whether the inquiry under the Land Revenue Code could be conducted despite the determination made under the Jagirs Abolition Act regarding the respondent's rights to minerals. The appellants' appeal challenges the High Court's judgment
[Ratio of the decision] The central question in this appeal is whether, once the competent authority declares a jagir (land grant) as proprietary under the Bombay Merged Territories and Areas (Jagirs Abolition) Act, 1953, a further inquiry under the Bombay Land Revenue Code (BLRC) is valid to determine the rights of the jagirdar (recipient of the grant) to mines and mineral products within the jagir. The court addresses two specific questions: 1. In the specific case, the court concludes that the inquiry initiated by the Collector under BLRC was invalid as the respondent had already made applications for recognition of his rights to gravel and stones, and the inquiry was not relevant. In summary, the court rules that a further inquiry under BLRC can be conducted after a jagir is declared proprietary, unless the proprietary determination is explicitly based on mining rights. In this specific case, the respondent's inquiry was invalid as it was unnecessary and unfair

[Facts] The appellant challenges a judgment by the Madhya Pradesh High Court, which dismissed their writ appeal on the grounds of non-maintainability. The appeal was filed under Section 21 of the M.P. Uchacha Nyayalay Khand Nyaypeth Ko Appeal Adhiniyam 2005 (referred to as the "Act"). The High Court determined that the order in question was made under the power of superintendence under Article 227 of the Indian Constitution. A special leave petition was initially filed with the Supreme Court against the order, which was disposed of on February 16, 2006. The appellant sought to set aside the decision of the assessing officer in the writ petition
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant's objection to the maintainability of the Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) is rejected by the court. The High Court's interpretation of the order as merely waiving the limitation for filing an LPA is incorrect. The High Court's judgment is also flawed in considering only the nomenclature of the writ petition rather than the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved. The appellant argued that the writ petition should be considered under Article 226 of the Constitution, but the respondent's invocation of both Article 226 and 227 in the writ petition makes the appeal against the learned single judge's judgment maintainable under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The appellant's contention that the Letters Patent Appeal is not maintainable is not valid

[Facts] The appellant, a trust, sought permission to establish an engineering college and received conditional approval from the AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) based on expert committee recommendations. The division bench stated that the appellant could reapply for permission or request consideration for a future academic year. Point 1: The AICTE granted conditional approval based on expert committee recommendations, providing specific conditions and guidelines. The state government's refusal lacked reasons. The government's counter also noted the need to assess the necessity for more engineering graduates and employment opportunities
[Ratio of the decision] The points of consideration in the case are as follows: 1. Whether, in light of the judgment in the "State of Tamil Nadu v. Adhiyaman Educational & Research Institute," the AICTE Act 1987 covers the necessary approvals, rendering additional government or authority approval unnecessary and any state law requiring such approval void. The process of granting approval for new technical institutions involved consultations with various committees, councils, and experts. It highlights that, even if Kerala had a law requiring government approval for technical institutions, such a law would be void due to the repugnancy established in the Tamil Nadu case. Furthermore, the petitioner's case was already filed in the Delhi High Court, and the court finds it premature to proceed at this stage

[Facts] This civil appeal is brought by special leave against a judgment and decree dated November 29, 1977, issued by a single judge of the Gujarat High Court. 921 of 1966 filed in the Joint Civil Judge's Court, Baroda. The plaintiff had borrowed money from defendant 1 and executed two mortgage deeds in 1961. The court granted a preliminary decree for redemption of the properties. Subsequently, the defendants filed a second appeal in the Gujarat High Court, challenging the judgments of the trial court and the appellate court
[Ratio of the decision] Firstly, whether the leasehold rights of a tenant merge into a mortgage security if the same property is given by the landlord to the tenant as mortgage security under a mortgage by conditional sale, preventing the tenant from resisting the landlord's suit for possession recovery by obtaining a redemption decree. In this context, the court examines whether the leasehold estate of a tenant merges into a mortgage security created by the landlord if the same property is used as security for a mortgage by conditional sale. It is determined that if the landlord mortgages the leasehold property of the tenant to the tenant himself, the right of reversion remains with the landlord. The court also addresses whether a civil court can decide the issue of tenancy under the BT&AL Act if a defendant raises such a claim. The court references a previous case (Topandas vs. Harkishandas) involving jurisdiction under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, and establishes that a defendant's claim cannot force a plaintiff into a forum that doesn't correspond to the true facts and nature of the case

[Facts] This case involves a dispute over trademark rights. The respondents registered the trademark "Raleigh" and other marks under various trademark acts. They entered into agreements to provide technical assistance for manufacturing bicycles using their trademarks. The court noted that the appellant failed to prove continuous non-use of the trademarks and lacked bona fide intention. Overall, the court upheld the dismissal of the rectification application, determining that the respondents' conduct did not warrant rectification of the trademarks
[Ratio of the decision] The core question in this case is whether the High Court's decision to refuse the rectification and removal of the respondents' trademarks from the trademark register was correct. The court questioned whether the appellant could be deemed a bona fide user despite not having an agreement or registration as a permitted user under Section 48(1). The court also mentioned that even unregistered licensees could establish a trade connection through a course of dealings. The court addressed Section 46(3) of the Act, stating that it wasn't applicable due to the continuous use of the trademark by the appellant through Sen Raleigh. The court concluded that the High Court had properly exercised its discretion in refusing to rectify and strike off the trademark from the register based on the facts and circumstances of the case

[Facts] In this case, the respondents faced trial for various criminal offenses, including conspiracy and misappropriation, under the Indian Penal Code. The State also filed an application to revise the sentences given to the respondents. Dissatisfied with this outcome, the State of Andhra Pradesh appealed to the Supreme Court. Subsequently, various industrial concerns were started under the management of the original company. The trial court found both respondents guilty of multiple charges, but the High Court acquitted them
[Ratio of the decision] The passage discusses a legal case involving multiple respondents and charges related to criminal activities within a company. The first respondent, Ganeswara Rao, was an old employee of AECO and was appointed as secretary of VESCO. The charges include criminal breach of trust, falsifying accounts, and using forged documents. The court's interpretation of these provisions is debated, considering different scenarios involving various charges and respondents. The case involves arguments about the legality of granting a pardon to an approver under certain sections of the Criminal Procedure Code

[Facts] The case revolves around the interpretation of Indian income tax laws related to agricultural income. The appellant, Mrs. Bacha F. Guzdar, was a shareholder in two tea companies that engaged in growing and manufacturing tea. The question was whether 60% of the dividend she received from these companies could be considered agricultural income and thus exempt from taxation. The High Court upheld the decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, agreeing that the dividend income could be considered agricultural income under the Indian Income Tax Act. This case is significant for its interpretation of the tax treatment of dividend income from agricultural activities
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's main point is that the dividend received by a shareholder from a company is not considered agricultural income within the Indian Income Tax Act. The court reasoned that the dividend is not directly derived from the shareholder's connection with the land where agricultural activities take place. This right exists independently of any dividend declaration. The court distinguished between a shareholder's position in a company and a partner's role in a firm, emphasizing that a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. The court emphasized the importance of analyzing the language and context of the Indian tax law itself to determine the meaning of terms like "agricultural income.

[Facts] The case involves a member of the Madras Legislative Assembly who was initially disqualified due to a conviction but sought exemption to run for a by-election. Despite his application being rejected by the Election Commission, he filed his nomination, won the election, and became a member. The member challenged this process in court, arguing that the disqualification existed before the election and should have been challenged through an election tribunal. The case revolves around the applicability of Article 192 of the Constitution in such a scenario. The member sought a writ of mandamus or prohibition against the Commission's reference
[Ratio of the decision] The court held that the power of the high court to issue writs under Article 226 of the Constitution is subject to limitations: the writs cannot extend beyond the court's territorial jurisdiction, and the person or authority to whom the writs are issued must be within that jurisdiction. The court found that the High Court of Madras lacked jurisdiction to issue a writ against the Election Commission since the Commission was located in Delhi. Furthermore, the court examined the question of disqualification of a member of the legislature and whether the term "become subject to disqualification" in Articles 190(3) and 192(1) of the Constitution referred to disqualifications arising after election. The court agreed with the lower court's interpretation that these articles apply only to disqualifications incurred after a member's election. Therefore, the Governor and the Election Commission did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the respondent's disqualification, which had existed before his election

[Facts] The case involves a respondent who was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The initial investigation by Subinspector Mathur was conducted without obtaining the required permission from a magistrate. Later, Mathur received permission and conducted a detailed investigation, leading to the submission of a charge sheet. The respondent was convicted by a Special Judge but was acquitted by the High Court on the grounds of irregular investigation. The Court emphasized that irregularities in investigation alone cannot lead to acquittal unless they seriously prejudice the accused
[Ratio of the decision] The court determined that the accused's conviction should not be set aside due to irregularities in the investigation process. The initial investigation by Subinspector Mathur was conducted without proper permission, violating the Prevention of Corruption Act. However, Mathur rectified this by subsequently obtaining the required permission from a magistrate of the 1st class. In this case, as the trial was fair and the evidence compelling, and the defect in the investigation was rectified with a proper investigation, no prejudice was caused to the accused. The court criticized the high court's focus on the initial irregularity and its failure to consider whether the accused was prejudiced during the trial

[Facts] The appellant company purchased surplus materials through contracts and disputes arose with the Union of India, leading to arbitration. The appellant applied to set aside the award, claiming that it suffered from errors and misconstructions. They argued that the umpire failed to consider certain documents, misinterpreted the scope of sales, and acted beyond jurisdiction. The umpire determined the term "reverse land lease" and whether certain vehicles were covered by the sale. The appellant's arguments centered on contract misconstructions, omitted evidence, jurisdiction issues, and errors in the umpire's findings
[Ratio of the decision] The ratio of the decision revolves around the interpretation of the Arbitration Act (1940), Section 30 regarding the setting aside of an award due to an error apparent on the face of the award. If a dispute relates to compensation for vehicles removed by one party, and if the arbitration clause covers disputes "arising under" or "in connection with" the contract, the umpire's jurisdiction extends to determining compensation. An arbitrator's decision, even if based on a legal proposition, is not necessarily unsound on the face of the award. The mere consideration of a legal point doesn't incorporate a document into the award. An error must be evident from the face of the award, and the court shouldn't look beyond to determine if documents were misconstrued

[Facts] In a legal case dated April 11, 1969, involving civil appeal number 165 of 1974 and related matters, the court dismissed the appeal and special leave petitions. The court ordered an ex gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to the appellant as a final settlement for their claim. It was directed that the respondents must deposit Rs 50,000 within three months in the trial court. The case originated from a judgment by the Kerala High Court on October 22, 1973, in S.A. No. The deposited amounts with the trial court could be withdrawn by the respondents
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the High Court interpreted Section 7d and determined that its benefits applied only to those whose land occupation had a lawful origin. The appellant's possession was found to be a result of trespass, and their claim of adverse possession as the owner was rejected. The High Court's decision to deny protection under Section 7d was upheld. The court stated that the section intended to protect those with lawful land possession, such as those who believed they could later seek government assignment or leased land from competent lessors. The appellant's claim of adverse possession was deemed insufficient for protection under Section 7d

[Facts] In this legal case, plaintiffs filed a suit against defendants claiming ownership of a disputed property. The judicial commissioner concluded that the defendants failed to prove full title acquisition through prescription. The court also dismissed the defendants' claim of perpetual lease. The appellate court then evaluated the evidence, finding that the plaintiffs had been in continuous possession of the entire land, including the part with the defendants' house. The defendants were directed to remove their house and return vacant possession of the plot to the plaintiffs
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the defendants, who are the appellants, were being sued by the plaintiffs for ownership of a disputed property. The defendants initially opposed the construction by the plaintiffs on a part of the land but later agreed. However, the defendants denied the plaintiffs' title to the part where the defendants' house stood and showed open hostility to the plaintiffs' claim. It was found that permissive possession is insufficient to establish title and that the defendants' long and open possession with repudiation of the plaintiffs' title had ripened into ownership. The court determined that the plaintiffs had also acknowledged the land as the defendants' property, and the defendants' possession had lasted for many years, establishing the plea of adverse possession

[Facts] The petitioners filed a petition under Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure Code in 1973, along with Order XXXVI of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966. This was done during the investigation stage of their case, seeking a transfer of their case to a different court. However, the court dismissed their petition for transfer
[Ratio of the decision] The court clarified that while Section 406 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the transfer of appeals from one high court or subordinate court to another, it does not grant authority to transfer investigations from one police station to another across the country merely based on the forwarding of initial information or remand reports to a court. The petitioners had misunderstood the scope of Section 406. Since there was no pending case before any court, the court dismissed the petition. The court advised that if the petitioners were concerned about the inconvenience of travel or judicial process, they should seek appropriate remedies through other means, as justice should be pursued without causing harassment. The court emphasized that courts should use their processes to advance justice, not to cause undue hardship to parties

[Facts] Ishroo Devi filed a suit to recover certain properties based on a will executed by Purohit Mani Ram. The appellants, who were the son, wife, and granddaughter of Mani Ram, contested the suit, alleging that the will was forged and the properties were ancestral and thus could not be disposed of by a will. The trial court accepted the evidence of witnesses who attested to the authenticity of the will and ruled in favor of the respondent. The trial court found that two of the properties were ancestral, and the will was valid. The appellants appealed to the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir, which modified the lower court's decision, holding that one of the properties was ancestral, while the other two were self-acquired
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court examined the validity of a testamentary will that disposed of ancestral property to a distant relative. The main issues addressed were whether the will was valid under the Jammu & Kashmir Hindu Succession Act and whether the income of a hereditary priest could be considered as ancestral property. The court found that the will was valid, rejecting claims of forgery and unnaturalness. It also determined that income from a hereditary profession is not joint family property and confirmed the status of certain properties as self-acquired or ancestral. The court held that under the Jammu & Kashmir Hindu Succession Act, a wife has a share equal to that of a son and remitted a question about the extent of the interest that could be disposed of by the will back to the high court for further consideration

[Facts] In this case, a writ petition was filed to challenge an order of detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974. The petitioner argued that the order of detention should be quashed. The detenu, after being served with the detention order, submitted a representation on September 27, 1979, which the government received on September 28, 1979. The detenu's representation raised several points. The court's judgment was delivered by Justice Fazal Ali
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the court considered the issue of delay in deciding a representation filed by a detenu under Article 22(5) of the Indian Constitution. Any unexplained delay in deciding the representation would violate the constitutional guarantee. The court emphasized that the obligation of the detaining authority to decide the representation is distinct from the obligation to constitute a review board. The court held that the detaining authority cannot wait for the board's opinion and must decide the representation promptly. In this specific case, the representation was not explained or detailed in a timely manner, which rendered the detention void

[Facts] Special leave was granted by the court, and a delay of six days in filing the case was condoned. 4064/X-960/4-58 dated 14th December 1957 and Notification No. 4064/X-960/4-58 dated 25th November 1958. Subsequently, on 1st December 1973, another notification was issued that brought cotton fabrics under the purview of sales tax, specifically within Item No. 18 of the schedule as added by Section 4 of the said Act
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled on the issue of taxation based on notifications under the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act. The notifications in question included one from 1958 that exempted cotton fabrics of all kinds from sales tax, and another from 1973 that imposed sales tax on beltings of all kinds. The court held that the exemption for cotton fabrics would prevail over the later notification, and thus, patta, treated as cotton fabric, would remain exempt from sales tax. The majority judges held that the exemption applied as long as it existed, even if specific items were notified for taxation under a different provision. One judge dissented, arguing that the specific item notification under a later provision could not override the general exemption under the earlier provision

[Facts] The case involves a joint family business with a sugar factory. After partition, the family formed a partnership and operated the factory. Eventually, both leases were terminated by mutual agreement. The question was whether the amounts received from these partners were taxable as income. The receiver of the factory claimed enhanced depreciation allowance based on the value of a partner's share, but the claim was rejected
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the appellant received amounts from partners due to lease termination, claimed depreciation on a 1/6th share in a sugar mill acquired through exchange, and sought to set off an unabsorbed loss against income. The court held that the amounts received were taxable income as they were in the nature of profits from business interest. Depreciation couldn't be claimed for a fractional share, and the claim for set off was denied as the business nature differed. The appellant's appeals were dismissed in all instances

[Facts] This legal case pertains to the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973, involving sections such as 3, 4(1), 15(2), and 40(1). The act introduced changes to the earlier Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955, which aimed to determine ceiling areas for agricultural holdings. A notified date was established, and subsequent amendments were made. In 1973, a new ordinance repealed certain provisions and recognized specific transfers made during the old law's operation. This ordinance was replaced by the 1973 Act, retroactively effective
[Ratio of the decision] In the decision's core, the court considered whether certain provisions of the old law should be upheld despite the enactment of the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973. The court concluded that Section 6 would not apply to exclude the old law. Thus, the provisions of the old law were applicable to these cases. The court concluded that the accrued rights and liabilities were sufficient to invoke the old law's provisions for pending cases, and that the new law's provisions did not eliminate these rights and liabilities. In summary, the court's decision determined that accrued rights and incurred liabilities under the old law were preserved and applicable to pending cases, despite the enactment of the new law

[Facts] This case involves an appeal against the dismissal of a writ petition by the Allahabad High Court. The tribunal found the termination not punitive but based on service assessment. The appellant appealed against this to the Supreme Court. The appellant's contention that the termination was mala fide due to his union activities was dismissed. The tribunal and the High Court's decisions were upheld, and the court dismissed the appeal, ordering the appellant to be paid Rs 75,000 by the Jal Nigam within three months
[Ratio of the decision] The decision's key points are as follows: 1. The appellant's contention that the termination was mala fide and unjust was not accepted. The court highlighted that for compulsory retirement, stale adverse entries from over ten years ago should not be considered, and only recent service records should be taken into account, provided adverse entries had been communicated to the employee. The order of confirmation was found to be illegal and in violation of the interim order of injunction. In conclusion, the appellant's appeal was dismissed, and while the court did not interfere with the termination, they directed the U.P. Jal Nigam to pay the appellant Rs 50,000 within four months

[Facts] In this case, the appellant challenged his dismissal from service through a series of legal actions. However, the High Court dismissed the suit on the grounds that complex factual issues were involved. The appellant had previously filed a writ petition against the dismissal order, which was dismissed by the High Court, stating that the matter involved intricate questions of fact. References to previous cases were made to support the appellant's arguments. Ultimately, the legal proceedings revolved around the appellant's dismissal from service and whether the dismissal order was valid under the law
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the appellant's dismissal from service was challenged in court. The appellant's argument that the jurisdiction of the civil court was not ousted by Section 20 of the Act was supported by legal references, including the case of Ram Swarup v. Shikar Chand, where it was stated that the section would not operate when the impugned order is a nullity. The High Court's reliance on certain observations made in the previous proceeding was deemed erroneous. The Supreme Court concluded that the dismissal order was passed in violation of a mandatory provision and was therefore null and void. Despite this, the proper course of action was not to automatically set aside the dismissal order, but rather to require the employer to furnish a copy of the proceeding to the appellant and assess whether the failure to provide the copy had prejudiced the appellant's case

[Facts] The appellant in this case, M/s United Glass Bangalore, is a manufacturing unit within the Khoday group of industries, engaged in bottling alcoholic beverages. They established their own bottle manufacturing unit, and the dispute is about the valuation of the bottles produced from 1st July 1979 to 30th June 1983. The appellant filed two price lists that were provisionally approved, but the excise authorities found them to be significantly below the cost of production. They issued show cause notices proposing to redetermine the values of the bottles. The Collector of Central Excise appealed to the Customs, Excise, and Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal, which found that the appellant's declared prices were far below cost and unacceptable
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the respondents are directed to pay differential duties as the department is entitled to finalize assessments based on the value of goods supplied within the Khoday group. The Central Excise Valuation Rules of 1975 govern the valuation of excisable goods under Section 4(1)(b) of the Act. Rule 6 allows for valuation if the goods' value can't be determined under other rules, requiring the price at which the goods would be sold in wholesale trade to a non-related person. Rule 7 pertains to cases where the goods are not sold but used in production. The appellant argues that once the revenue adopts a value, it cannot switch to another basis, which the court disagrees with, stating that such a stance isn't supported by the law

[Facts] In this case, the appellant is challenging a land acquisition process. A notification was issued in 1985 to acquire 5 acres and 21 gunthas of land for the construction of the Hemavathi left bank canal. 4800 per acre, but the Civil Judge later increased it to Rs. 20000 per acre based on evidence of the crops being grown. 10000 per acre with additional amounts and interest
[Ratio of the decision] After examining the case's details, it has been concluded that a reasonable compensation of Rs. A3 (a document) has been presented, but it pertains to land with coconut trees and is irrelevant for this case's compensation determination. The respondent is entitled to enhanced compensation

[Facts] In the given case, the appellants were accused of murdering a gram sarpanch. The trial court convicted several persons, but the High Court acquitted most of them and reduced the sentence for others. The incident occurred when the victim was attacked by the accused with lethal weapons. The Supreme Court analyzed the evidence and found the High Court's judgment erroneous. The Court also discussed the reliability of witnesses and their motives
[Ratio of the decision] In the given case, the Supreme Court found that the High Court's decision to convict the accused only of the offence under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code was erroneous. The Court determined that the assailants who participated in the brutal attack resulting in the victim's death cannot escape conviction under section 302 with the aid of section 34, if not section 149. The Court assessed the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies and highlighted inconsistencies and doubts regarding their claims. As a result, the Court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were the assailants who attacked the deceased. The appeal of two of the accused was allowed, and their convictions were set aside

[Facts] This case involves an appeal arising from a Karnataka High Court order dated 19th September 1990. The respondents, Doddaramaiah and Chikkaramaiah, were granted agricultural land under Rule 43(8) of the Mysore Land Revenue Code. The appellant, who obtained title to the land after the expiry of ten years from the government assignment, claimed title by adverse possession. The appellant contended that there was no prohibition against him and cited precedent to support his argument. The issue revolves around whether the respondents challenging the sale of land to the appellant are estopped from doing so and whether the sale is valid, along with considering whether the appellant perfected his title by adverse possession
[Ratio of the decision] The court considered the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978, which prevents the alienation of assigned land intended for the economic betterment of marginalized communities. The appellant had acquired the land through a registered sale deed before the act was enacted. Rule 43A specifically prohibits alienation of assigned land and does not impose a time limitation. The court's earlier decision (Veeranna vs. State of Karnataka) on the same issue affirmed that adverse possession does not apply against the state unless the purchaser has a valid title. The court concluded that the Act's prohibition on alienation applies to the situation, emphasizing economic justice for marginalized sections of society

[Facts] The appellant was dismissed from service based on a dismissal order dated April 24, 1987, issued by the employer (respondent no. 1) following an inquiry into charges against the appellant. The appellant challenged his dismissal through an industrial dispute, and the state government referred the dispute for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal. The Industrial Tribunal dismissed respondent no. The high court's reasoning was not provided in the summary
[Ratio of the decision] The Supreme Court reviewed the case and found that the reasons given by the High Court for allowing the withdrawal of the approval application were not sustainable. The Court disagreed with the notion that proceedings under Section 6(e)(2)(b) and those on reference under Section 4(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act cannot be allowed to continue simultaneously. The Court noted that the scope of proceedings under these two provisions is different, and they can be pursued concurrently. The Court also did not offer an opinion on whether the prayer for withdrawal could be declined. In essence, the Court kept all questions open for further consideration

[Facts] The appeal pertains to a case in which the appellant union claimed to represent workers in a canteen operated by the respondents. The union asserted that even though the workers were effectively employees of the respondents, the respondents treated them differently and engaged contractors to run the canteen. The union filed a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971, alleging unfair labor practices by the respondents. The complaint was dismissed by the industrial court. The appellant union directly filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court against this dismissal
[Ratio of the decision] The decision states that the provisions of the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act (MRTU&PULP Act) can only be enforced by individuals who are confirmed as workmen. If there is a dispute about whether employees are considered employees of the company, this dispute should be resolved first through the appropriate legal process. Only after the workmen status is established can a complaint be filed under the MRTU&PULP Act. As a result, the complaint filed by the appellant union was deemed not maintainable. The court also emphasized that any observations or findings made by the industrial court in the impugned order would not affect the decision made in the appropriate forum regarding the employment status dispute

[Facts] This case involves two tenants who were renting a property owned jointly by two sisters. The property was later divided through partition proceedings, and the tenants claimed that the owners treated them unfairly and engaged contractors to run a canteen on the premises. The tenants filed a complaint under the Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act (MRTU&PULP Act), alleging unfair labor practices. The industrial court dismissed the complaint, stating that the tenants' workmen status needed to be resolved before filing a complaint under the MRTU&PULP Act. The court emphasized that the dispute about the tenants' employment status should be resolved first through the appropriate legal process before filing such a complaint
[Ratio of the decision] This case involves co-owned property that was divided through partition proceedings. The property had two tenants who continued to hold their tenancies. Later, due to various legal actions and transfers, the case reached the appellate court. In this case, one co-owner sold her share, and some partners of the tenant firm bought that share. The court also found that the decree for eviction should not be available for execution for three months to allow the tenants time to make the necessary deposit

[Facts] The appellant is contesting a case wherein the second respondent filed a complaint against the appellant and his wife under the Prized Chits and Money Circulation Scheme (Prohibition) Act and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The Chief Judicial Magistrate ordered the complaint to be sent to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The appellant challenged this order in revision, which was dismissed by the Sessions Court. The High Court ruled that even though police investigation can commence without a magistrate's order, when a magistrate orders an investigation after taking cognizance of the offense in a complaint, it should be followed. The appellant is now contesting this decision in an appeal
[Ratio of the decision] The accused challenged the legality of an order for investigation issued by a magistrate in response to a private complaint. However, their efforts were unsuccessful. This appeal arose from those proceedings. Different High Courts had taken differing views on this matter. Furthermore, the Court emphasized that a magistrate's order for investigation under Section 156(3) can be made without examining the complainant on oath or the witnesses present at the time of filing the complaint

[Facts] This case involves a motor accident claim brought before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal in Ludhiana. The claimant, the mother of a deceased teenager, alleged that her son died due to the reckless driving of the second respondent, who was driving a goods vehicle. The Tribunal accepted the claim and ordered the insurance company to pay compensation of Rs 1,32,000 with interest. The appellant insurance company contested, arguing that as the vehicle was a goods vehicle, they shouldn't be liable for passengers. However, the Tribunal and subsequently the High Court upheld the decision, and the High Court added that if the owner of the vehicle had committed any breach, the insurance company could recover the compensation amount from him
[Ratio of the decision] In this case, the issue revolves around whether an insurance policy for a goods vehicle covers gratuitous passengers. The court considers whether this wording encompasses gratuitous passengers as well. The court emphasizes that the legislative intention was to provide third-party risk coverage and that the changes introduced in the 1988 Act differ from the 1939 Act's provisions. The court also clarifies that the insurer can recover the amount from the owner through a proceeding before the executing court, as governed by Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The court's decision takes into account changes in the law and the scope of insurance coverage for different types of passengers in goods vehicles

[Facts] Residents of Santiniketan filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the Calcutta High Court, concerned about the defacement of the ambiance and environment around Visva Bharati University. The university's purpose and ideals were being compromised due to the construction of residential and commercial complexes by developers without regard for environmental laws. The Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA) had undertaken various public benefit works in the area. However, the High Court dismissed the PIL, stating that since the university didn't own the entire 3000 acres of land, no relief could be granted. The court's decision was based on whether the land was specially acquired for the university's purpose
[Ratio of the decision] The act establishing Visva Bharati University was enacted with the aim of preserving its uniqueness, tradition, and special features as a unitary teaching and residential university. The constitution does not provide for a charter but designates the Union government responsible for institutions of national importance. The act's purpose was to disseminate knowledge, understanding, and free communication of ideas, as envisioned by Rabindranath Tagore when founding the university. The Santiniketan Sriniketan Development Authority (SSDA) should distinguish itself from other development authorities, considering the environmental impact and the university's distinct character. The Court recognized the need to balance development and preservation, allowing ongoing construction by Bengal Peerless while directing SSDA to abide by legal provisions and previous observations in future activities

[Facts] The case involves two appeals filed against a judgment by the High Court of Judicature at Madras in favor of the Coast Guard and the underwriters of a vessel. The vessel, named "Kobe Queen" or "Gloira Kopp," was found loaded with steel products in Indian territorial waters. The crew sought wages from the vessel's sale proceeds, but the Coast Guard opposed, resulting in legal proceedings. The crew argued for wages from the auction proceeds, asserting a maritime lien, which the High Court accepted. The Commissioner of Customs' order proposing confiscation was held not to affect the crew's claim for wages
[Ratio of the decision] The decision of the court can be summarized as follows: 1. There is no question of making any first charge on the vessel, and the crew's legal dues must be considered to prevent further suffering. The court criticized the view that confiscation automatically extinguishes the crew's maritime lien, stating that it only suspends their rights temporarily. The court emphasized the importance of recognizing customary practices in admiralty law. The court held that the crew's right to wages is not limited to the ship's sale but also includes proceeds from the sale of cargo

[Facts] The respondent in this case sought a modification of the price indicated in an allotment letter issued by the appellants for land acquisition. The dispute involved several legal proceedings, including a writ petition and appeals. A writ petition was filed seeking price modification in an allotment letter, and the high court granted relief, directing the application of a rate prevalent in 1985. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel argued that there was confusion regarding co-sharer entitlements for the plot and that previous decisions established principles relating to allotments. In summary, the case involves a dispute over land allotment pricing due to co-ownership claims
[Ratio of the decision] The case involves an allotment scheme for residential plots to individuals whose land was acquired for urban development. The respondent received an allotment under the scheme, and changes were made to the scheme later on. At the time of allotment in 2001, the rate was Rs 3200 per square yard. Given these facts, the high court's direction to apply the 1985 rate is untenable. The appellant's rate mentioned in the allotment letter from 2001 stands

[Facts] The appeals challenge a Karnataka High Court judgment dated February 15, 2001, concerning Defense Research & Development Organization (DRDO) technical cadre recruitment rules. The appellants, former chargemen grade II in the Ministry of Defence, sought to invalidate Rule 6(4)(a) of the DRDO recruitment rules, claiming it violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Rule 6(4)(a) placed individuals with specific qualifications in a higher grade (category II) and others in a lower grade (category I). The appellants lacked the qualifications mentioned in the rule's schedule, leading to their placement in category I. They argued that this division of chargemen grade II personnel based on qualifications was discriminatory. The court concluded that this categorization did not infringe Article 14
[Ratio of the decision] The court rejected the appellants' argument that Rule 6(4)(a) violated Article 14 of the Constitution by adversely affecting their promotion prospects. The court emphasized that established legal precedents support the practice of categorization based on educational qualifications. It reiterated that such categorization is permissible under Article 14, and the fact that chargemen grade II with the qualifications mentioned in the rule's schedule were placed in a more favorable category was not a violation of the principle

[Facts] The appellant was a defendant in a suit concerning a property in West Bengal. The plaintiff claimed ownership of the property based on registered deeds of conveyance. An ex parte decree was passed in favor of the plaintiff, and the appellant did not file a written statement but testified as a witness. The appellant's objection to an application for amending the decree's schedule was rejected by the executing court and upheld by the high court. The appellant contended that the impugned order disregarded relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and could be rectified
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that the mistake in describing the suit property was an accidental error and not intentional, and thus, the plaintiff's application for amendment of the plaint and decree was permissible. The court emphasized that such corrections must be clear and not raise disputed questions. If the amendment is necessary to correct accidental slips or omissions, it is within the scope of Section 152, but if it goes to the merits of the case or is intentional, other remedies like appeal, revision, or review should be sought. In this case, since the appellant was aware of the issues and participated as a witness, the missing description in the schedule did not warrant interference. The court also ruled that parties not bound by the decree were not entitled to impleadment

[Facts] The case involves appellants who were appointed as chargeman grade II, and due to a slight difference in marks, they were appointed as supervisor grade A. A government order allowed them to appear in the next examination to qualify as chargeman grade II. Later, the posts of supervisor grade A and chargeman grade II were directed to merge. The order was partially modified by the Supreme Court, and the central government challenged it. Despite the dismissal of the government's appeal, it did not comply with the order, leading to a contempt petition. The respondents argued that appellants were entitled to promotions and notional seniority at each level based on the interpretation of the tribunal's judgment
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that appellants who were graded as supervisor grade A should be allowed another chance to take an examination to become chargeman grade II. This policy would have retrospective effect to cover past cases where the authorities had already allowed supervisory apprentices another chance. The court clarified that while retrospective promotion might not always come with retrospective seniority, those given notional seniority should not be disadvantaged compared to regularly appointed individuals. The court criticized the denial of benefits to the appellants despite similar cases receiving them, finding this unjustifiable. The judgment entitles the appellants to the benefits as contemplated, and the state cannot treat similarly situated employees differently

[Facts] The cases involve disputes related to passenger status and insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act. In one category of cases, the question pertains to unauthorized passengers and their entitlement to insurance claims. The judgments in these cases examine whether the individuals were authorized passengers, owners of goods being transported, or mere gratuitous passengers. The judgments of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunals, as well as the High Courts, vary based on the evidence and circumstances presented. The Satpal Singh case is cited as a precedent in some cases to determine the scope of insurance coverage for such situations
[Ratio of the decision] The cases involve the interpretation of insurance coverage under the Motor Vehicles Act, specifically section 147. The question revolves around whether insurance companies are liable to pay compensation for the death or injury of passengers in goods vehicles. The context suggests that "any person" in section 147 of the 1988 Act refers to third parties, not passengers in goods vehicles. In some cases, the courts uphold the insurance company's position, stating that the policy doesn't extend to passengers in goods vehicles. The judgments also clarify that the absence of insurance coverage for passengers in goods vehicles isn't a violation of the policy and doesn't warrant denying compensation to claimants

[Facts] This case involves an appeal challenging the judgment of a single judge of the Orissa High Court. After various proceedings and adjournments, it was revealed that the appellant had passed away. The Supreme Court examines the principles governing such situations. The court emphasizes that the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, doesn't directly apply to appeals before the Supreme Court, especially those granted through special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution. In the present case, the court notes that the interest of the legal representatives is contingent as it involves claiming arrears of salary based on the overturning of the conviction
[Ratio of the decision] In cases where an appeal is against a sentence of fine, it may be continued even after the death of the appellant. However, if the sentence is one of imprisonment, and the accused dies, the appeal would abate since the sentence becomes infructuous and doesn't affect the property of the deceased in the hands of their legal representatives. There's no valid reason for different rules to apply to appeals under Article 136 of the Constitution compared to other appeals, so the widow of the deceased appellant can continue the appeal since the fine sentence directly affects the property. The court refers to the principles of Section 394 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which can be applied in appeals before the Supreme Court. Although a statutory period of 30 days is fixed for such applications, the court notes that the application was filed nearly a year later without an acceptable explanation for the delay

[Facts] This case involves a State appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Criminal Appeal No. The respondent, Kalyan Singh, was acquitted of charges related to the killing of two individuals during a conflict. The prosecution argued that Kalyan Singh fired shots leading to the deaths, while the defense presented an alternative version that implicated others. The trial court convicted Kalyan Singh, but the High Court acquitted him due to several doubts raised, including delayed witness statements, conflicting evidence, non-compliance with legal procedures, and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. The High Court gave Kalyan Singh the benefit of doubt and set aside his conviction and sentence
[Ratio of the decision] The State appeals against the acquittal in Criminal Appeal No. The High Court had acquitted the respondent, Kalyan Singh, due to certain circumstances creating doubt about the prosecution's case. The State challenges this decision, arguing that the circumstances referred to by the High Court were not significant enough to disprove the clear evidence presented by the prosecution witnesses. The State contends that factors like the delay in recording statements of certain witnesses, discrepancies in reports, and the failure to send the report to the nearest magistrate were relevant and material. The State seeks a review of the High Court's decision based on these points

[Facts] The appellant challenges an order by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Criminal Petition No. The appellant filed a complaint against respondents, alleging dishonoring of a cheque. The High Court quashed the complaint against the fourth respondent, stating that the complaint was not properly signed by the payee's power of attorney holder. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, stating that the complaint was validly filed by the payee's power of attorney holder. The High Court's order was set aside, and the case was directed to proceed as previously ordered by an interim order
[Ratio of the decision] The crux of the decision is that a complaint signed by an attorney holder is maintainable for offences under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complainant must satisfy the eligibility criterion prescribed by the statute, which in this case requires that the complaint be by the payee or the holder in due course. The court concludes that a proprietary concern (sole proprietorship) can file a complaint in the name of the concern itself, either by the proprietor, by describing the concern as a sole proprietary concern represented by the proprietor, or by the attorney holder under a valid power of attorney. The assumption that a complaint by an attorney holder of a proprietary concern is not valid is incorrect, and such a complaint is maintainable. The court further asserts that there is no irregularity in the procedure of the attorney holder being examined as the complainant during court proceedings

[Facts] This case involves an appeal against a division bench's order that allowed a letters patent appeal filed by respondents against a single judge's order in a writ petition. The appellant raised the preliminary objection that the appeal was not maintainable. The respondent trust was registered under the Madhya Public Trust Act, 1951. The division bench held that the single judge's decision was incorrect, remanding the case back to the single bench for proper consideration. The appellant also contended that all parties affected by the order should have been heard
[Ratio of the decision] The court ruled that a person can resort to writ jurisdiction when they are unable to file a suit under Subsection (1) of Section 8. The petitioner's absence as a party before the registrar during the inquiry means that the petitioner's claim is not covered by the registration order. If a matter is inadequately dealt with or dismissed without proper consideration, it should be set aside, and the issue should be fully addressed. Injunctions or setting aside orders should be decided in the civil court, not remanded to a single bench. Questions of title or the competency of the settler to establish trust can be resolved in civil suits

[Facts] In this case, the appellant sought permission to run a co-education school, which was granted initially but challenged by the first respondent who already ran a secondary school. The Bombay High Court set aside the initial permission and directed reconsideration with a hearing for both parties. Subsequently, the permission was canceled and later reconsidered, leading to a legal battle. The High Court canceled the renewed permission. The appellant had been running the school for about eight years, and the Court decided to permit them to continue due to the circumstances, disregarding technical objections by the first respondent
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant sought permission to run a school, which was granted and later canceled due to legal challenges. The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court. The objection to the school's continuation was raised by the first respondent, a rival school, claiming there was no need for another school and that competition might lead to closure of existing schools. The state government stated that more schools were needed in the area and there was no harm in healthy competition. The appellant's school had been running for nearly eight years without negatively affecting the rival school

[Facts] The appellant was a witness in a criminal case where he reported an assault and his statement was recorded during the investigation. Subsequently, a complaint was filed accusing the appellant of conspiring in the crime. The judicial magistrate issued process against the appellant and others based on the complaint. The High Court stated that the appellant was not an accused in the police case and the protection against self-incrimination could not be extended. The appellant's request for protection from self-incrimination was denied based on the distinction between his status as a witness and an accused
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant was involved in a criminal case as a witness where he provided a statement during the investigation. The court considered whether his situation warranted such protection. The appellant, not being an accused in the police case, wasn't entitled to blanket protection. However, if a question arose during his testimony that could incriminate him, he could claim protection then. The court emphasized that the appellant's situation didn't warrant granting blanket protection and clarified that his right to refuse answering self-incriminating questions would be upheld during the trial

[Facts] The appellant filed a criminal revision in the Supreme Court of India after respondents 2 to 8 were acquitted by the trial court for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The appellant, who was the informant in the case, argued that the trial court didn't take adequate measures to secure the attendance of prosecution witnesses, leading to the wrongful acquittal. However, the High Court rejected the revision petition, stating that the trial court had indeed taken reasonable steps to secure witness attendance. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision
[Ratio of the decision] The appellant filed a criminal appeal (No. 1145 of 2003) in the Supreme Court of India, being dissatisfied with the High Court's decision in the case involving Sukhdeo Jha

[Facts] Dr. Sadankumar Goel, the husband of the deceased Dr. Asha Goel, filed a criminal writ petition (No. 1930 of 2006) requesting that the authorities take appropriate action under Section 166A of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. The High Court directed the investigating agency to send the collected materials to a forensic laboratory in Canada for examination, as Dr. Asha Goel was a Canadian citizen of Indian origin. The investigation involved a confession by the accused, the seizure of blood-stained clothes, and the involvement of the Canadian coroner in preserving genetic material. The Court's decision aimed to address the limitations of domestic forensic laboratories and ensure a thorough investigation into the case
[Ratio of the decision] The High Court's decision to direct the investigating agency to send materials for forensic examination to Canada was based on the lack of suitable facilities for mitochondrial DNA analysis in India. The Court noted that this examination could provide crucial evidence for the investigation and help ascertain the culpability of the accused. The appellant argued that the prosecution had not made the necessary application or obtained a letter of request from a competent court of law to collect evidence from Canada. The respondent countered that the appellant's objection was an attempt to avoid materials that could implicate the accused, and the state government acknowledged the unavailability of mitochondrial DNA testing facilities in India. The Court concluded that the evidentiary value of the materials could be assessed during the trial, and it was not appropriate to intervene at this point

[Facts] The case involves the Indian Institute of Technology (the Institute) and its employees who were initially hired as junior and senior research assistants, and technical assistants. Some of the employees filed a petition seeking classification as academic staff. Meanwhile, the Institute increased the age of superannuation to 62 years for certain personnel but excluded the laboratory superintendents. The High Court disposed of the two petitions together. The Institute challenged this order, arguing that post classification is the Institute's prerogative under statute 11 and should be based on functions and duties
[Ratio of the decision] The Supreme Court ruled that the classification of posts within the Indian Institute of Technology (the Institute) is determined by the functions and duties performed by the employees. The Court emphasized that the Institute has the authority to classify posts into academic, technical, or administrative categories through appropriate resolutions. However, since the posts of laboratory superintendents had not been classified under any specified category, and since they were considered as supernumerary posts, the Court ordered that until their classification is determined, the respondents (employees) should retain their original category classification before their promotion to laboratory superintendents. The Court further directed the Institute's Board of Governors to classify the post of laboratory superintendent under the relevant statute, taking into account their duties. The Court allowed the appeals and provided specific directions to clarify the classification of the respondents' posts
