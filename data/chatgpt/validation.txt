[Facts] the division bench of the bombay high court in letters patent appeal no. 30 2010  1. 3   the appellant no  1 is a public limited company having its registered. kalwe  thane  and houses the plant that manufactures switchboards for the. company  the appellant employs about 2200 employees  the appellant no  2 is. the chief manager  personnel  of the said company. 4   respondent no  1  the contesting respondent  is a registered trade union. of the workers employed by the appellant no 1  it is recognized under the. provisions of the maharashtra recognition of trade unions and prevention of. unfair labour practices act  1971  hereinafter  referred to as the maharashtra. act   respondent no  2  the pro forma respondent  represents the switchboard. 5   in 2007 the trade union preferred a complaint under section 28 of the. maharashtra act for unfair labour practices  jointly and severally against the. company  its chief manager for personnel  appellant no  2  and its works. manager  respondent no 2  before the learned industrial court  thane. maharashtra  the trade union impugned a notification dated 3rd may  2007. issued by the company for its workmen employed in its factory located in. kalwe  whereby applications were invited to appear for a selection process to. undergo a two year long period as an  officer trainee   this training was to. and technical sales order execution  the notification stated that after the. successful completion of the said two years  the trainees were to be. an officer belonging to the management cadre  in fact it was merely a 3. have been legislated by a state for the prevention of unfair labour practices. unfair labour practices have been alleged  provide as follows. 9   failure to implement award  settlement or agreement. 10   to indulge in act of force or violence. 15   in paragraph 3  b  of the complaint it has been alleged that the. respondent union is anticipating that the management is likely to reduce the. work of the workmen category and give it to the newly recruited officer. trainees  it has also been alleged that by doing so the management is acting. 16   the precise findings of the labour court  thane while dealing with the. complaint of the union about change of condition of service under section 9 a. of the industrial disputes act are as under. considering the evidence that even earlier also  the company has. reduced the strength of the employees in various departments  they were. the management is indulging in any act of unfair labour practice. 23   even then the labour court  thane  has come to certain findings of unfair. labour practice against the management and which have been referred to above. 24   the appellant company challenged the finding of the labour court before. the high court by filing a writ 14 petition  the learned single judge in his. judgment noted that the main grievance of the respondent  union was that in. the process of reorganizing its work pattern the management of the appellant. company was reducing the number of posts of workmen and some of the work which. were done by the workmen are to be done by the officers and the grievance of. the respondent union was that this was contrary to clause 7 of settlement. dated 16th november  1982  hereinafter  the said settlement    ultimately  the. learned single judge came to a finding that though the post which is. introduced by the management is named junior executive  the said post was. different from the post of junior executive which was in existence and after. saying so the learned single judge held   the tribunal has rightly held that. this amounted to unfair labour practice under item 9 of schedule iv of the. said act   para 9   the learned single judge also noted that even though. of the work of the workman along with some additional work  this  15 according. to the learned single judge  was in breach of clause 7 of the said settlement. 25   the appellant company also challenged the said order of the learned. single judge before the division bench  the division bench came to a finding. that whatever work is given to the officers trainees in addition to the. present work was the work of a workman  so even if the workmen are promoted. these findings  the division bench affirmed the finding of the learned single. judge. the appellant company acted in breach of clause 7 of the agreement  it is well. known that an industrial settlement is entered into between the management and. labour for maintaining industrial peace and harmony  therefore  any attempt by. industrial unrest and amounts to an unfair labour practice  here the charge of. unfair labour practice against the appellant company 18 is that it has. violated item 9 of schedule iv of the maharashtra act  item 9 has been set out. that while adjudicating on the complaint of the union both the labour court. and the high court should have taken into consideration all subsequent. settlements between the management of the said company and the union in 1985. 1988  1992  1997 and 2004  both the labour court and the high court failed to. notice that in its complaint the union has accepted that they are not. objecting to the promotion being granted to the workers  however  the said. stand of the workers union is not consistent with the nature of the complaint. filed before the labour court  21. 30   the admitted facts are  there are 89 vacancies in the category of. officers and 154 workers have applied  therefore  everybody who has applied. termination of service of the appellant govind raj as his termination led to. an industrial dispute  in that dispute numerous primary objections were raised. by ciba geigy and one of them was that govind raj was not a workman within the. meaning of section 2 s  of the industrial disputes act  in that context  this. court  after analyzing the evidence  came to a finding that govind raj was a. workman within the meaning of the act and held that neither the labour court. remanded the matter to the labour court for deciding the dispute in accordance. with its judgment  the said decision has no bearing on the issues with which.
[Ratio of the decision] workman  with little additional duties  resultantly  the junior executive. officers of the factory were now to do the very same work that had always been. done by the workmen. conditions of service of the workmen  as some vacancies available for workmen. in the switch board unit were to be reserved for officers from the management. cadre  resultantly there would have been a reduction in the job opportunities. for workers  according to the trade union  any such change could not have been. affected without giving the workmen a prior notice to such effect in terms of. section 9a of the industrial disputes act  1947  in this regard  the trade. union referred to an agreement entered into between itself and the company in. 1982  the said agreement  titled 4  rationalization and transport settlement. has clause  7   the said clause is as follows    7   that employees or officer. or staff categories shall not be asked to do normal production work. 7   the union also referred to clause  12  of the agreement which is as. follows    12   that this settlement shall not be utilized for eliminating the. further employment potential or promotional opportunities to the existing. workmen. 8   clause  16  is set out herein below. 16   this agreement shall come into force with effect from 01 01 1981 except. clause no 14 which shall have effect from 16 11 1982 only and shall remain in. operation until it is changed in accordance with the provisions of law. 9   clause  7  ensures that the job opportunities for workers shall not be. reduced by the company by making its managerial staff perform the workmen s 5. job  clause  16  ensured the perpetuity of this settlement until expressly. overruled by a subsequent settlement  it was submitted by the trade union that. the change sought to be brought about by the company by its notification dated. 3rd may  2007  was in violation of clause  7   the trade union thus complained. that the company and its two officers resorted to unfair labour practices. mentioned in items 9 and 10 of schedule iv of the maharashtra act  and had. thereby violated the mandate of section 27 of the maharashtra act. notice as contemplated by clause  a  of section 9a read with entry 11 of the. fourth schedule of the industrial disputes act  6. 11   the maharashtra act was the first enactment of its kind in the country to. and consequent victimization  it was a comprehensive legislative device to. days from the date of the alleged occurrence  if good and sufficient reasons. are shown by the complainant for the late filing of the complaint. 14   in the instant case the complaint has been filed under section 28 read. with section 30 2  of the maharashtra act by the respondent union and in the. instant complaint the respondent union alleged that the management is. indulging in unfair labour practices under item nos 9 and 10 of schedule iv of. the maharashtra act  para 3 a  of the complaint   schedule iv of the. maharashtra act categorizes the general unfair labour practices on the part of. the 8 employers  under schedule iv  item nos 9 and 10  in respect of which. this allegation in the complaint is concerned  the order of industrial court. thane  shows that it did not find that the management was in any way trying to. change the condition of the service or it was 9 acting in violation of the. provisions of section 9 a. 17   therefore  the complaint of the respondent union  which ultimately found. favour with industrial court as unfair labour practice  is the attempt made by. the management in not implementing clause 7 of settlement. 18   in this aspect the exact finding of the labour court is as follow. considering the nature of work to be performed by these officer s. trainee  certainly it shows that there s breach of clause 7 of the settlement. dated 16 11 1982  as such  the complainant union has succeeded to prove the. unfair labour practice under item 9 of schedule iv of the act. 19   before proceeding further in this matter  this court proposes to examine. the concept of unfair labour practice and the way it has been dealt with under. the maharashtra act and also under the id act  any unfair labour practice. within its very concept must have some elements of arbitrariness and. unreasonableness and if unfair labour practice is established the same would. bring about a violation of guarantee under article 14 of the constitution. therefore  it is axiomatic that anyone who alleges unfair labour practice must. plead it specifically and such allegations must be established properly before. any forum can pronounce on the same  it is also to be kept in mind that in the. changed economic 11 scenario  the concept of unfair labour practice is also. required to be understood in the changed context  today every state  which has. to don the mantle of a welfare state  must keep in mind that twin objectives. of industrial peace and economic justice and the courts and statutory bodies. while deciding what unfair labour practice is must also be cognizant of the. aforesaid twin objects. 20   unfair labour practice  for the first time  was defined and codified in. the maharashtra act referred to hereinabove  but in so far as the industrial. disputes act  central law  is concerned  unfair labour practice was codified. and brought into force by the amending act  46 of 1982 with effect from 21st. august 1984. practice to mean the practices specified in the fifth schedule and the fifth. schedule was also inserted by the said amending act  12 the fifth schedule has. two parts  the first part refers to unfair labour practices on the part of the. labour practices on the part of the workmen and trade union of workmen. however  there is some difference between the provisions relating to unfair. labour practices in the maharashtra act and those in central act i e. industrial disputes act  the industrial disputes act prohibits an employer or. workmen or a trade union from committing any unfair labour practice while the. maharashtra act prohibits an employer or union or an employee from engaging in. any unfair labour practice  the prohibition under the industrial disputes act. is aimed at preventing the commission of an unfair labour practice while the. maharashtra act mandates that the concerned parties cannot be engaged in any. unfair labour practice  the word  engage  is more comprehensive in nature as. any manner  it may be also mentioned here that no workmen of the appellant. company has made any complaint either to the management or to the union that. court normally does not interfere with 16 concurrent finding and  therefore. should not interfere with the concurrent finding in the instant case. 27   it is true that this court normally does not upset a concurrent finding. but there is no such inflexible rule  the jurisdiction of this court under. article 136 is a special jurisdiction  this is clear from the text of the. article itself which starts with a non obstante clause  this is a jurisdiction. conferring residual power on this court to do justice and is to be exercised. solely on discretion to be used by this court to advance the cause of justice. this article does not confer any right of appeal on any litigant  but it. simply clothes this court with discretion which is to be exercised in an. appropriate case for ends of justice  therefore  there can be no hard and fast. rule in the exercise of this jurisdiction  just because the findings which are. assailed in a special leave petition are concurrent cannot debar this court. from exercising 17 its jurisdiction if the demands of justice require its. interference  in a case where the court finds that the concurrent finding is. based on patently erroneous appreciation of basic issues involved in an. adjudication  the court may interfere  in the instant case the court proposes. to interfere with the concurrent finding for the reasons discussed. hereinbelow. 28   admittedly  the finding of unfair labour practice against the appellant. company by the high court and the labour court is based on the premise that. either the management or the workmen to violate such a settlement may lead to. hereinabove and the purport of item 9 is that any failure to implement an. award or settlement or agreement would be an unfair labour practice  in the. instant case while considering clause 7 of the said settlement the courts have. not taken into consideration clause 12  both clauses 7 and 12 have been set. out hereinabove  if a harmonious reading is made of clauses 7 and 12 it will. be clear that clause 7 cannot be given an interpretation which makes clause 12. totally redundant  clause 7 contains a prohibition against the employees or. officers or members of the staff of the appellant  company from doing normal. production work  but that cannot be read in such a manner as to nullify the. purport of clause 12 which reserves the promotional employment potential of. existing workmen  so in the instant case if by way of rearrangement of work. the management of the appellant company gives promotional opportunity to the. existing worker that does not bring about any violation of clause 7 of 19 the. said settlement rather such a rearrangement of work will be in terms of clause. 12  at the same time if some of job of executive officers are the same as is. done by the existing worker that does not bring about such a violation of. clause 7 as to constitute unfair labour practice. 29   what is restricted under clause 7 is asking the officers to do the normal. production work  there is no blanket ban in asking the officers from doing any. production work  therefore  both clause 7 and clause 12 of the said settlement. must be reasonably and harmoniously construed to make it workable with the. evolving work culture of the appellant company in facing the new challenge in. the emerging economic order which has changed considerably from 1982  even if. we assume that 1982 agreement still subsists even then when a challenge is. made of unfair labour practice on the basis of violation of a clause of 1982. agreement on the basis of a complaint filed in 2007  the labour court and the. high court must 20 consider the said agreement reasonably and harmoniously. keeping in mind the vast changes in economic and industrial scenario and the. new challenges which the appellant company has to face in the matter of. reorganizing work in order to keep pace with the changed work culture in the. context of scientific and technological development  this court also finds. cannot be promoted  only a certain percentage of the workers applying can be. promoted  both the labour court and the high court failed to take into. consideration that the workers voluntarily applied for the promotion scheme. pursuant to its introduction  nowhere has it been alleged by the workers that. any force or pressure was brought upon them to apply  in the background of. these facts the question is when the workers applied on their own to a scheme. of promotion introduced by the management and they do not make any complaint. either to the union or to the management in respect of the introduction of the. scheme  can it be said that by introducing a promotional scheme the management. is indulging in unfair labour practice  the union is supposed to represent the. interests of the workers  when the workers themselves do not consider the. scheme as unfair to them  can the union take upon them the burden of saying. that the scheme is unfair  22 in the instant case the respondent union is. unfortunately seeking to do that  both the labour court and the high court. have failed to appreciate this basic fundamental issue in their adjudication. and have  therefore  come to an obviously erroneous finding  apart from the. aforesaid clear factual position legally also the management of the company is. not prevented from rearranging its business in the manner it considers it. best  if in the process it does not indulge in victimisation. 31   reference in this connection may be made to a decision of this court in. parry   co  ltd  v  p c. pal   ors   reported in air 1970 sc 1334  a three judge bench of this court. held as follows    it is well established that it is within the managerial. working pattern by introducing the scheme of promotion any person is either. retrenched or is rendered surplus. 33   in the given situation  this court cannot appreciate how by introducing. the scheme of promotion to which the workers overwhelmingly responded on their. own can it be said that the management has indulged in unfair labour practice. applicable here. performing multifarious duties and the issue is whether he is a workman or not. the test to be applied is what was the primary  basic or dominant nature of. the duties for which the workman was employed  this court came to the. conclusion 25 that when the primary and basic duties of an employee are. clerical but certain stray assignments are given to him to create confusion. the court may remove the gloss to find out the reality. 36   in arkal govind raj  supra  the aforesaid question arose out of the. nor the high court came to a correct finding  with that finding this court. we are concerned in this case  26 it is well known that the ratio of a. decision has to be appreciated in its context  going by that principle  we do. not find that the decision in arkal govind raj  supra  is of any assistance to. the respondents. relating to trade unions and unfair labour practices in india  fourth. uses his power of promoting employees in a manner calculated to sow discord. among his workmen  or to undermine the strength of their union  he is guilty. 38   in the instant case no malafide has been alleged by the union against the. appellant company in the matter of reorganization of its work  it is also. nobody s case that as a result of the reorganization of the work any attempt. is made by the appellant  company to create discord amongst the workmen so as. to undermine the strength of the union  apart from that the facts in the case. of l h  sugar factories  supra  are totally different  in l h  sugar factories. supra  the company wrongfully deprived ten workers of their promotion to the. post of driver cum assistant fitter while preferring eleven other workmen over. them  this led to an industrial dispute  therefore  those observations of. allahabad high court in a totally different fact situation are not attracted. in the present case to make out a case of unfair labour practice  we fail to. appreciate the relevance of the aforesaid decision to the facts of the present. case  28. 39   at the same time it is not the case of the respondent union that its. recognition is in any way being withdrawn or tinkered with  nor is it the case. of the respondent union that it is losing its power of collective bargaining. it may be that the number of workmen is reduced to some extent pursuant to a. promotional scheme to which the workmen readily responded  but no union can. insist that all the workmen must remain workmen perpetually otherwise it would. be an unfair labour practice  workmen have a right to get promotion and. improve their lot if the management offers them with a bona fide chance to do. so  in fact if the order of the high court is upheld  the same will go against. the interest of erstwhile workmen of the appellant company who have responded. to the scheme of promotion. 40   for the reasons aforesaid  we are of the view that the high court failed. to have a correct perspective of the questions involved in this case and. obviously came to an erroneous finding  29. 41   we allow the appeal and set aside the order of the high court in which. has merged the order of the labour court  however  we make it clear that in. implementing the scheme the management of the appellant company must not bring. about any retrenchment of the workmen nor should the workmen be rendered. surplus in any way.

20267   being the first in a. series of landmark orders passed by this court in an effort to save the fast. diminishing forest cover of the country against the greedy and wanton. plundering of its natural resources  in that order the court gave a number of. the district collector  gautam budh nagar  by its letter dated february 26. survey of india  hereafter  fsi   in order to verify the vegetation cover over. the area before the construction work started there  in light of the report by. the ccf  the moef noted that the number of cut trees  in ratio to the project. area  was apparently more than three times in excess of the criterion fixed by. the state level expert committee for identification of forest like areas. i e   minimum of 50 trees per hectare   as suggested by the ccf  therefore. the moef called for a report from the fsi based on satellite imagery and. properly analysed by gsi application from the year 2001 15 onwards  vide. letter dated july 17  2009 from the dy  conservator of forest  c  to the. director  forest survey of india   the fsi gave its report on august 7  2009. report of the fsi showed that the forest cover existed there up to 2006 and. the felling of trees might have taken place after that only. 9   in the meeting convened by the cec on the applicants  complaint on august. government  in view of the stand taken by the ccf  the cec by its letter of. august 13  2009 requested the moef to give its response on the issue  here it. hit by the provisions of the fc act  but now in a perceptible shift in its. stand the moef informed the cec by its letter of august 22 24  2009 that in. its view  the project site did not attract the provisions of the fc act  it. referred to the order of this court dated december 12  1996 and pointed out. that the project site did not appear in the list of deemed forest land. identified by the state level expert committee in pursuance of the order of. the  forest  conservation  act. 1980  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act fa1980241. 10   the letter dated august 22 24  2009 from the moef was followed by another. letter of september 2  2009  this was purportedly to put the observation in. the previous letter that      c onstruction work in this area does not attract. the provisions of the  forest  conservation. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act fa1980241   1980   in. context  this letter referred to the satellite images provided by the fsi and. the reports submitted by the ccf but in the end   given the 17 sensitivity of. natural regeneration exist. 29   as per the definition of  forest  as held by the hon ble supreme court in. its order dated 12 12 1996  the project area therefore cannot be treated as. forest  for the purpose of the  forest  conservation. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act fa1980241. emphasis added. on the scene  further  in the second response of the moef  dated august 22 24. 2009 there is a reference to the information furnished by the deputy. horticulture officer  noida according to which plantations were taken up along. with seed sowing of subabul during the year 1994 95 to 2007 08  a total of. 9 480 saplings were planted  including 314 saplings planted before 1994 95. noida had treated this area as an  urban park. 22   it is  thus  to be seen that on a large tract of land  33 45 hectares in. area  that was forever agricultural in character  trees were planted with the. object of creating an urban park  and not for afforestation. the trees  thus  planted were allowed to stand and grow for about 12 14 years. when they were cut down to make the area clear for the project. 23   the satellite images tell us how things stand at the time the images were. the  forest  conservation. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act fa1980241   or the andhra. the aravalli hills range 30 over the years by mostly illegal mining  the. the nature and the area of the project it was not covered by the schedule of. clearance under the eia notification 2006  it further stated that in the eia. notification 2006  all building  construction projects  area development. projects and townships  were categorized as category  b  projects and the. of the moef before he cec was evidently based on the inputs received from the. up government about the nature of the project and the extent of constructions. involved in it. 35   in the second response before the cec dated september 2  2009 the moef. did not appear so sure of its earlier stand  it stated that after its earlier. letter of august 22  24  2009  the moef had received further information about. the project from various sources and the fresh findings raised far reaching. issues of public concern that extended beyond the parameters set by the eia. notification of 2006  it further stated that the certificate issued by the. seiaa of up stated that the total built up covered area was only 9 542 square. metres and the report of the ccf was not clear as to the extent of the covered. relating to the project and its likely impact on the environment  it left the. decision in the hands of the cec. 36   the cec in its report to this court dated september 4  2009 held and. found that the project was covered by the eia notification 2006 and it. required prior environmental clearance in terms of the notification  in its. report  the cec observed as follows. 30   the cec does not agree with the stand taken by the state government as. well as the moef that the project does not require environmental clearance in. terms of the moef notification dated 14 9 2006  the moef  as well as the state. of uttar pradesh has taken this view primarily on the ground that the built up. area of the project is less than 20 000 sq  meter and therefore the project. does not require environmental clearance  the built up area has been. calculated by the state of uttar pradesh on the basis of its building bye. laws  the cec is of the view that for the purpose of environmental clearance. the building bye laws of the state government have no relevance at all  as per. the details provided by the state government itself  out of 33 43 ha of the. project area  3499 50 sq  meter is being used for memorial building   toilet. blocks  3500 sq  meter is being used for utilities and facilities  129140 80. sq  meter area is being used for hard landscape including for platforms. plinth  sculptures   surrounded paved area  path etc. another 34850 sq  meter area is to be used for vehicular movement  the above. comes to more than 50  of the project area which in cec s view qualify to be. as per the moef notification dated 14 9 2006  for building construction. included in the built up area  in the present case  after including the. activity area the total built up area  for the purpose of environmental 35. clearance  far exceeds the threshold limit of 20 000 sq. meter of built up area provided in the notification  the moef  on its own. admission  has merely relied on the details of the built up area as provided. by the state government without independently verifying it and has not. insisted for the environmental clearance. 37   when the matter finally came up before the court the moef was once again. asked to take a clear stand on the issue whether the project was covered by. the eia notification 2006  the moef filed a brief affidavit on october 21. 2009 in which it acknowledged that the cec in its report dated september 4. 2006 had stated that the state of up should be directed to seek environmental. projects  the stand of the moef was based on the premise that the area of the. project  33 43 hectares  was less than 50 hectares and its built up area. 9 542 square metres  was less than 20 000 square metres  having thus made 36. its stand clear  the moef went on to say that in case the court desired the. project to be appraised from the environmental angle it would do so and submit. its recommendations  it  however  put in a caveat that such appraisals were. made before the commencement of the construction activity at the site and in. the present case the project was already in the advanced stage of. construction. 38   on april 22  2010  this court passed an order in which after extracting. the relevant passage from the affidavit it directed the moef  to make a study. of the environmental impact of the project  the moef was further directed to. suggest measures for undoing the environmental degradation  if any  caused by. 39   as directed by the court  the moef asked the project proponents to submit. the details concerning the project in the format prescribed under the eia. notification  it also asked the project proponents to have the environmental. impact assessment of the project done by some expert agencies  as required by. the moef  noida submitted the requisite details concerning the project and the. reports on the environmental impact assessment of the project based on studies. on june 28 29  2010 and gave its report which is brought on record along with. an affidavit filed by the state government on july 22  2010  in this report. the eac made as many as 15 recommendations to check any environmental. degradation or any harm to the okhla bird sanctuary by the project. the schedule to the eia notification  2006 without changing its stand that the. advanced by the two sides on that basis  section 3  3  of the ep act provides. 4   categorization of projects and activities    i  all projects and.

development. was situated well outside the boundaries of the bird sanctuary and the. construction of the project had caused no adverse impact on the sanctuary  it. was further stated that noida which was the project proponent was equally. conscious about its responsibility in regard to the preservation and. conservation of the habitat of the sanctuary  a management plan for the. sanctuary was being prepared by the wildlife institute of dehradun for which. noida had released rs 17 35 350 00 in favour of the institute and the noida. was also 57 planning to set up a corpus for the scientific and effective. implementation of the management plan. 62   on this issue the moef in its responses before the cec put the blame. squarely on the state government  it stated that despite its letter of may 27. 2005 followed by a number of reminders the government of uttar pradesh did not. submit its proposal for declaration of  eco  sensitive zone  around the. sanctuaries and national parks  it further stated that the state government. passed on december 4  2006 in writ petition  civil  no  460 2004 by which the. moef was directed to give all the states final opportunity to send their. proposals for declaration of  eco sensitive zones  to the moef within four. the state government of uttar pradesh was trying to take advantage of its own. omission  in its second response dated august 22 24  2009  however  the moef. though still blaming the up government for its failure to notify the  eco. nbwl  had earlier decided that area within 10 km around national. parks sanctuaries should be the eco sensitive zone  later on  it was decided. by the nbwl that eco sensitive zone should be specific to each national. park sanctuary  the cec had recommended that 500 meter around national. park sanctuary should be declared as eco  sensitive zone  the recommendation. of the cec has not so far been accepted by the hon ble supreme court after the. learned amicus curiae took a view that 500 meter may not be adequate  pursuant. to this hon ble supreme court order dated 4 8 2006 in the twp matter  mining. is presently prohibited up to a distance of one kilometre from the boundary of. national parks sanctuaries  for other projects  no restriction has so far been. imposed  the moef has time and again requested the states ut s to identify the. eco sensitive zone around the national parks sanctuaries  however  the state. of uttar pradesh has so far not prepared any proposal in this regard  the cec. 68   earlier in the judgment  it is noted that on april 22  2010  the court. done by some expert agencies  noida  the project proponent got three studies. the salim ali centre for ornithology and natural history  sacon   deccan. regional station  hyderabad and the all india network project on agricultural. ornithology  aacharya n g. ranga agricultural university  hyderabad  annexure ii of paper book volume. iv   the other by the wildlife institute of india  wii   annexure iii of paper. book volume iv   and the third by a group of three individuals that was vetted. by the indian institute of technology  new delhi  annexure iv of paper book. volume iv. 69   the sacon  in its report practically gave a clean chit to the project and. made the following observations in connection with the felling of trees and. the impact of the project construction on the okhla bird sanctuary. 7 the entire development works including removal of trees and construction had. taken place outside the boundary of the sanctuary and the construction and. felling of trees in the project site has not altered or interfered with the. wetland ecosystem of the obs and the area was undisturbed. 7 the birds in the wetland of okhla bird sanctuary are estimated during the. used by 51 101 species of terrestrial birds and was an extended habitat for. the wildlife of the okhla bird sanctuary  primarily terrestrial birds  some of. these birds may be using the erstwhile woodland for breeding as well. the erstwhile woodland was acting as a buffer against these. disturbances  the project area which was in continuation with the vegetation. along the left afflux bund was providing a green belt approximately 2 km long. and 218 m wide on and average  before the felling of trees this patch might. have acted as a protective green belt of approximately 190 m width with a tree. density of 203 5 trees  ha  density of trees felled  which is now reduced to. approximately 28 m  between the western wall of the project and obs boundary. of left afflux dam   from this it is concluded that the sanctuary lost its. buffer of around 33 43 ha that will have significant impact on the obs and its. tranquility. 65     such carbon sequestration value of the erstwhile woodland was lost. though the noida has already taken up ameliorative steps in form of. with the loss of buffer and increased artificial light at the project. site  it is likely that the migratory bird population may get affected in long. run  bird friendly diffused light with blue tinge may reduce the negative. iv  page 134  that would form part of this judgment. 73   the iit  new delhi in its review of the report prepared by the group of. three people does not record any serious negative finding in regard to the. effects that the project may have on the sanctuary. 74   finally  the expert appraisal committee  eac  constituted by the. government of india  moef in its 88th meeting held on june 28 29  2010. 68. out of place  the eia notification dated september 14  2006 urgently calls for. a close second look by the concerned authorities  the projects activities. been more comfortable if the environment impact studies were 69 made by the. recommended by it. 80   the ias stand disposed of with the above

[Ratio of the decision] the ep act   and the notification issued under the act  more importantly  the. project was causing great harm  and was bound to further devastate the. delicate and sensitive ecological balance of the okhla bird sanctuary to which. a park that would develop and beautify the area in a unique way  the park was. conceived as a fine blend of hard and soft landscaping with memorial. structures and commemoration pieces  the construction of the park did not. violate any law or the order of the 4 court  there was no infringement of the. provisions of the fc act or the ep act or the notification made under it. undeniable. i  the project is sited at sector 95  noida  according to the applicants  at. nature and come here mainly during the winter months  the annual. population visit is estimated as under. wildlife  protection  act  1972  the project  subject of the present. controversy  is sited in very close proximity to the okhla bird sanctuary on. its eastern side  the applicants refer to it as adjoining the left afflux bund. of the okhla bird 6 sanctuary but to be accurate it lies about 35 50 metres. away from the outer limit of the sanctuary  according to the applicants  the. boundary of the project site is as under. north  delhi up dnd toll road south  not clearly stated east  dadri road west. illegal from every conceivable point of view  its construction was started and. complete  semi complete or under construction must be pulled down and the. project site be restored to its original state. the project and section 2 of the fc act. the time being in force in a state  no state government or other authority. shall make  except with the prior approval of the central government  any. order directing    i  xxxxxxx  ii  that any forest land or any portion thereof. may be used for any non forest purpose. iii  xxxxxxx  iv  xxxxxxx explanation   for the purpose of this section  non. forest purpose  means the breaking up or clearing of any forest land or. portion thereof for   a  the cultivation of tea  coffee  spices  rubber. and wild life  namely  the establishment of check posts  ire lines  wireless. communications and construction of fencing  bridges and culverts  dams. therefore  needs to be ascertained whether the project area can be said to be. the project. 12. directions. one such direction  at serial no 5 to each of the state governments  is as. under. each state government should constitute within one month an expert committee. to. constituted the state level expert committee for identifying forests and. forest like areas  the committee in its report dated december 12  2007 framed. certain parameters for identification 13 of forest like areas according to. which  in the plains  any stretch of land over 2 hectares in area with the. minimum density of 50 trees per hectare would be considered as  forest   on. districts in the state of uttar pradesh within four months and such areas. would be handed over to the forest department  excepting the private areas  if. any  as the process of search and identification of forest like areas in the. districts of uttar pradesh proceeded  the district level committee headed by. was no forest like area in the district and consequently the project site was. not identified as a forest or forest like area by the state level expert. committee constituted in pursuance of this court s order dated december 12. 2006. 8   it was in this background that the project started  according to the state. government  in january 2008  when the work on the project became noticeable. from the outside the applicants filed their complaint before the cec on march. 5  2009  as the controversy erupted with 14 regards to  large scale. construction near the okhla bird sanctuary by the state government  the. ministry of environment and forests  hereafter  moef   asked the chief. conservator of forests  ccf   central region  lucknow  to make a site. inspection of the project and to give his report  the ccf in his report dated. july 10  2009 did not accept the stand of the state government that there was. no forest on the project site  he stated that 6000 trees were  sacrificed  in. an area of. 32 5 hectares and that showed that the area had sufficiently dense forest. cover and would qualify as  forest  according to the dictionary meaning of the. word and as directed by the supreme court  he  however  suggested that before. taking a final view on the matter a report may be called for from the forest. any non forest use of the land required prior approval of the central. towards holding that the trees that were felled for clearing the site. comprised a forest deemed forest and the construction at the project site was. in view of the above  it is informed that the area under discussion is. neither recorded as forest nor deemed forest and actually an urban tree park. therefore  construction work in this area does not attract the provision of. the matter and the high degree of public interest  left it to the cec to draw. appropriate conclusions from the materials furnished to it. 11   the cec on a consideration of all the materials made available to it. including the report of the fsi  on which the applicants heavily rely   came. to hold and find that the project site was not a forest or a deemed forest or. a forest like area in terms of the order of this court dated december 12. 1996  in its report to this court dated september 4  2009 it observed in this. regard as follows. 28      in the present case  even though as per the report of the forest. survey of india  the area was having good forest tree cover and the project. area had more than 6000 trees  it does not fall in the category of  forest. for the purpose of section 2 of the  forest  conservation. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act fa1980241   and therefore. does not require any approval under the forest  conservation  act  the project. area does not have naturally grown trees but planted trees  the area has. neither been notified as  forest  nor recorded as  forest  in the government. project area was not identified to be deemed forest  the cec does not agree. with the regional chief conservator of forests  moef  lucknow that the. not be described as  forest  and did not attract the provisions of fc act. mainly because the trees in the project area that were cut down for making. space for the constructions were planted trees and not naturally grown trees. qualify as forest the trees must be  naturally grown  is fraught with grave. consequences inasmuch as a very large portion of the forests in india are. planted forests and not original  natural forests  further  any afforested. area would also cease to be recognized as a forest if the view taken by the. cec were to be upheld. 19. 13   the other reasons given by the cec for holding that the project area was. forest  in the government record and even in the exercise carried out by the. state of uttar pradesh  after detailed guidelines for identification of deemed. forest were laid down  the project area was not identified to be deemed. previous one  the area was not notified or recorded as forest meant nothing. since this court had passed a series of orders with the object to bring such. areas within the protection of the fc act that were not notified or recorded. as forest  in the same way the failure of the state level expert committee to. identify the project area as forest even though it fully satisfied the. criterion set by the committee itself for the purpose will not alter the true. nature and character of the area as forest land. guidelines made by the expert committee were reported to this court and. accepted by it on december 12  2007  the project site clearly did not come. within the parameters fixed by the expert committee and it was rightly not. identified as a forest like area  the parameters fixed by the expert committee. for identification of forests or forest like area were never challenged by. anyone and now it was too late in the day to question those parameters  more. non inclusion of the project site as a forest or forest like area by the state. level expert committee should be conclusive of the fact that the area was not. the expert committee were deficient and inconsistent with this court s orders. relies upon the report of the ccf based on site inspection and the google. image and most heavily on the fsi report based on satellite imagery and. analysed by gsi application  a satellite image may not always reveal the. complete story  let us for a moment come down from the satellite to the earth. and see what picture emerges from the government records and how things appear. on the ground. 20   in the revenue records  none of the khasras  plots  falling in the. project area was ever shown as jungle or forest  according to the settlement. year 1359 fasli  1952a d   all the khasras are recorded as agricultural land. banjar  uncultivable  or parti  uncultivated. 21   noida was set up in 1976 and the lands of the project area were acquired. under the land acquisition act mostly between the years 1980 to 1983  two or. three plots were notified under sections 4 6 of the act in 1979 and one or two. plots as late as in the year 1991   but the possession of a very large part of. the lands under acquisition  that now form the project site  was taken over in. the year 1983  from the details of the acquisition proceedings furnished in a. tabular form  annexure 9 to the counter affidavit on behalf of respondents no. 2   3  it would appear that though on most of the plots there were properties. of one kind or the other  there was not a single tree on any of the plots. under 24 acquisition  the records of the land acquisition proceedings  thus. complement the revenue record of 1952 in which the lands were shown as. agricultural and not as jungle or forest  there is no reason not to give due. credence to these records since they pertain to a time when the impugned. project was not even in anyone s imagination and its proponents were no where. taken  we are not aware whether or not the satellite images can ascertain the. and on the basis of those decisions the trees planted in the project area can. not be branded as  forest. 25   in order dated december 12  1996 in godavarman thirumulkpad this court. connected therewith  must apply to all forests irrespective of the nature of. ownership or classification thereof  the word  forest  must be understood. according to its dictionary meaning  this description covers all statutorily. recognised forests  whether designated as reserved  protected or otherwise for. the purpose of section 2 i  of the forest conservation act  the term  forest. land   occurring in section 2  will not only include  forest  as understood in. the dictionary sense  but also any area recorded as forest in the government. record irrespective of the ownership  this is how it has to be understood for. the purpose of section 2 of the act  the provisions enacted in the forest. conservation act  1980 for the conservation of forests and the matters. connected therewith must apply clearly to all forests so understood. irrespective of the ownership or classification thereof  this aspect has been. doubt  if any  in the perception of any state government or authority  this. has become necessary also because of the stand taken on behalf of the state of. rajasthan even at this late stage  relating to permissions granted for mining. in such area which is clearly contrary to the decisions of this court  it is. reasonable to assume that any state government which has failed to appreciate. the correct position in law so far  will forthwith correct its stance and take. the necessary remedial measures without any further delay. 26   in the above order the court mainly said three things  one  the. provisions of the fc act must apply to all forests irrespective of the nature. of ownership or classification of the forest  two  the word  forest  must be. understood according to its dictionary meaning and three  the term  forest. land   occurring in section 2  will not only include  forest  as understood in. the dictionary sense  but also any area recorded as forest in the government. record irrespective of the ownership  the order dated december 12  1996 indeed. gives a very wide definition of  forest   but any definition howsoever wide. relates to a context  there can hardly be a legal definition  in terms. absolute  and totally independent of the context  the context may or may not. find any articulation in the judgment or the order but it is always there and. it is discernible by a careful analysis of the facts and circumstances in. which the definition was rendered  in the order the court said  the term 28. forest land occurring in section 2  will not only include  forest  as. understood in the dictionary sense  but also an area recorded as forest in the. government record irrespective of the ownership   emphasis added. now what is meant by that is made clear by referring to the earlier decision. of the court in state of bihar v  banshi ram modi   1985  3 scc 643  in the. earlier decision in banshi ram modi the court had said. 10      reading them together  these two parts of the section mean that after. the commencement of the act no fresh breaking up of the forest land or no. fresh clearing of the forest on any such land can be permitted by any state. government or any authority without the prior approval of the central. government  but if such permission has been accorded before the coming into. force of the act and the forest land is broken up or cleared then obviously. the section cannot apply. 27   the observation in banshi ram modi  which again was made in the peculiar. context of that case   was sought to be interpreted by some to mean that once. the land was broken in course of mining operations it ceased to be forest. land  it was in order to quell the mischief and the subversion of section 2 of. the fc act that the court in the order dated december 12  1996 made the. observation quoted above italics. 28   in samatha  this court was dealing with cases of grant of mining leases. regulation and the mining act do not prohibit grant of mining leases of. government land in the scheduled area to non tribals. expanded the definition of forest is  thus  manifest and evident. context is once again evident. 30   almost all the orders and judgments of this court defining  forest  and. forest land  for the purpose of the fc act were rendered in the context of. mining or illegal felling of trees for timber or illegal removal of other. absolute terms  to an extent mr. bhushan is right in contending that a man made forest may equally be a forest. as a naturally grown one  he is also right in contending that non forest land. may also  with the passage of time  change its character and become forest. land  but this also cannot be a rule of universal application and must be. examined in the overall facts of the case otherwise it would lead to highly. anomalous conclusions  like in this case  mr  bhushan argued that the two. conditions in the guidelines adopted by the state level expert committee. i e    i   trees mean naturally grown perennial trees  and  ii   the. plantation done on public land or private land will not be identified as. forest like area  were not consistent with the wide definition of forest given. in the december 12  31 1996 order of the court and the project area should. qualify as forest on the basis of the main parameter fixed by the committee. if the argument of mr  bhushan is accepted and the criterion fixed by the. state level expert committee that in the plains a stretch of land with an area. of 2 hectares or above  with the minimum density of 50 trees  hectare would be. a deemed forest is applied mechanically and with no regard to the other. factors a greater part of lutyens delhi would perhaps qualify as forest  this. was obviously not the intent of the order dated december 12  1996. 31   in light of the discussion made above  it must be held that the project. site is not forest land and the construction of the project without the prior. permission from the central government does not in any way contravene section. 2 of the fc act. the project and the eia notification 2006. haste   without obtaining the prior environmental clearance from the central. government or the state level environment impact assessment authority in. complete violation of the 32 notification issued by the central government on. september 14  2006 under section 3  3  of the ep act. 33   before proceeding to examine the issue in detail it would be useful to. see the views taken by the different authorities  agencies and the moef on the. question whether the law required prior environmental clearance for the. project  it appears that once the controversy was raised  the project. proponents  by letter dated april 24  2009 approached the state level. environment impact assessment authority  uttar pradesh constituted under the. eia notification  2006  seeking environmental clearance for the project  in. reply the seiaa by its letter dated may 7  2009 stated that having regard to. the notification no  s o 1533  e  dated september 14  2006 issued by the. government of india. 34   before the cec  the moef in its first response dated august 22 24  2009. took the stand that the project would not require any prior environmental. general condition  prescribed in the 33 notification was not applicable to. construction projects  it went on to say that the project did not require any. prior environmental clearance under the eia notification 2006 even though. being within the prescribed distance from a wildlife sanctuary national park. or inter  state boundary   it needs to be stated here that the first response. included in the activity area  the project cost is about rs  685 crores. project  in the case of facilities open to the sky  the activity area is to be. included the area falling in the category of activity area  in any case  even. if there was any doubt in the moef regarding the applicability of the. environmental clearance in the present case  in view of precautionary. principle it should have erred on the side of the caution and should have. clearance for the project from the moef in terms of the notification  the. moef  however  reiterated its stand in very definite and unequivocal terms. that the project in question did not fall within the ambit of the eia. notification 2006 and no environmental clearance was required for such kind of. the project and the amelioration measures to safeguard the environment  with. particular reference to the adjacent bird sanctuary. made 37 by three different agencies  we shall have the occasion to consider. those reports in the latter part of the judgment   thereafter  the expert. appraisal committee  eac  constituted by the central government for the. purpose of the eia notification examined the project in its 88th meeting held. 40   the moef filed yet another affidavit before the court on august 19  2010. in which it tried to explain the distinction between clauses 8 a  and 8 b  in. project in question did not come within the ambit of the notification. 41   in course of the oral hearing as well  mr  raval  learned asg  firmly. maintained that the project did not come under the notification and no prior. environmental clearance was required for it under the notification. the moef was patently wrong and incorrect  the project clearly fell within the. ambit of the eia notification 2006  the cec had taken the correct view on the. issue. and to start the construction of the project and take it into an advanced. stage of construction without obtaining prior environmental clearance from the. central government was in blatant violation of the provisions of the. shifting and inconsistent stand on the issue. 43   now is the time to take a closer look at the

categorization of projects into b1 and b2  the moef would issue. appropriate guidelines from time to time  the schedule to the notification has. a table that is divided into five columns  the first column contains the. serial numbers  and the second the description of the project or activities. the third column lists those projects or activities that fall in category  a. and the fourth  those falling in category  b   the fifth column against each. item indicates whether any 45 general or specific condition applies to the. project or activity described in that item  in some cases where the project or. the activity is shown in column 4 as category  b   the application of the. general condition is expressly indicated in column 5 of the table. 46   for the project under consideration  the relevant entries in the schedule. are 8 a  and 8 b   both items 8  a  and 8  b  are listed in column 4  i e   in. category  b   in column 5  against any of the two items  there is no mention. of application of the general condition but it is expressly said that all. projects in item 8 b  would be appraised as category  b1   that is to say  for. a project under item 8 b  the prior environmental clearance must be preceded. by an environmental impact assessment. 47   item 8 a  deals with building and construction projects and the threshold. mark that would bring the project within the ambit of the notification is. equal to or more than 20 000 square metres and less than 1 50 000 square. metres of  built up area   it is further clarified that the aforementioned. figures relate to built up area for covered construction. in case of facilities open to the sky  the built up area would be the activity. area  item 8 b  deals with townships and area development projects and the. threshold mark for the project to come within the 46 ambit of the notification. is an area equal to or more than 50 hectares or built up area of more than. 1 50 000 square metres. land use  land cover or topography including increase in intensity of land use. with respect to local land use plan    ii  clearance of existing land. vegetation and buildings   iii  creation of new land uses  and  iv  pre. that in view of the definition of activity  virtually the entire area of 33 43. hectares from where over 6000 trees were removed for clearing the project site. would come within the  activity area  and would  thus  form the built up area. category  b  will be treated as category  a   if located within 10km from the. boundary of protected areas notified under the wildlife  protection  act. project by virtue of its very close proximity to the okhla bird sanctuary. regardless of the fact that in column 5 of the table there is no mention of. general condition would take the project out of category  b  and put it in. category  a  for which the competent authority to grant prior environmental. in item 8 a  of the schedule as a building and construction project  then  in. the second step  in order to cross the threshold marker he refers to the. definition of  activity  to contend that since the project provides facilities. open to sky its entire area of 33 43 hectares would constitute the built up. area  in the third step  he brings in the general condition  even though in. regard to item 8 a  its application is not mentioned in column 5 of the table. that would make the central government as the competent authority for granting. prior environmental clearance for the project  and lastly  in the fourth step. he refers to the office memorandum dated december 2  2009 to contend that a. clearance from the standing committee of the national board for 49 wildlife. was a precondition for the grant of the prior environmental clearance by the. moef. 50   long and elaborate submissions were made from both sides in regard to the. column 5 of the table then it would not make any sense to expressly mention it. in column 5 in respect of some other projects and activities classified in. category  b  in the schedule. 51   mr  raval  learned asg  produced before the court  the draft notification. no  s o  1324e  published in the gazette of india. extraordinary of september 15  2005  in the draft notification there were two. general conditions  gc1 and gc2 and in regard to  a   construction of all. projects  residential and non residential    and  b   new townships and. settlement colonies  the application of gc2 was 50 expressly indicated in. column 5 of the table  later on  in a meeting held on july 6  2006  chaired by. none else than the prime minister  it was decided to leave all construction. and township projects  housing and area development projects in the hands of. the state government  it was further decided that for all projects involving. more than 1 50 000 square metres of built up area and or covering more than 50. hectares  the eis requirements should correspond to category  a  even though. the clearance would be granted by the state government  mr  raval submitted. that in light of the decision taken in that meeting  in the final notification. issued on september 14  2006  the application of general condition was removed. in respect of items 8 a  and 8 b  in the schedule. in view of the changes made in the two items in the final notification  mr. 8 a  and 8 b   regardless of the project s proximity to any sanctuary or. reserved area. 52   but before considering the latter three limbs of mr  bhushan s arguments. it is necessary to examine whether the project in question can be legitimately. categorized as a building and construction project falling under item 8 a  of. the schedule which is the first premise of his arguments. 51. 53   in the schedule to the notification  building and construction projects. and  townships and area developments projects  are enumerated separately  the. former in item 8 a  and the latter in item 8 b   this would normally suggest. that the notification treats those two kinds of projects separately and. differently  it would  therefore  be reasonable to say that an  area. development project  though involving a good deal of construction would yet. not be a  building and construction project   when it was pointed out to mr. bhushan that the project in question may be put more appropriately in category. 8 b  as an  area development project  rather than a  building and construction. project  under category 8 a   in reply he took a line that nullifies any. distinction between the two  mr  bhushan submitted that so far as construction. projects are concerned there is no qualitative difference between items 8 a. and 8 b  and the difference between the two items was only quantitative. projects were categorized under items 8 a  or 8 b  as  building and. construction projects  or  townships and area development projects  not on the. basis of their nature and character but depending upon the extent of. project crosses the upper limit of item 8 a  the project would not fall within. that item  but at the same time since the project is a  building and. construction project  and not a  township and area development project   it. would not come under item 8 b  and this would be indeed a highly anomalous. position where a project with a smaller built up area would fall within the. ambit of the notification  whereas a project with a larger built up area would. escape the rigours of the notification. 54   the amicus  also arguing in the same vein  submitted that as far as. building and construction projects are concerned there was no qualitative. difference in items 8 a  and 8 b  of the schedule to the notification  a. combined reading of the two clauses of item 8 of the 53 schedule would show. the continuity in the two provisions  1 50 000 square metres of built up area. that was the upper limit in item 8 a  was the threshold marker in item 8 b. this clearly meant that building and construction projects with built up. area activity area between 20000 square metres to 1 50 000 square metres would. fall in category 8  a  and projects with built up area of 1 50 000 square. metres or more would fall in category 8  b   the amicus further submitted that. though it was not expressly stated  the expression  built up area  in item. 8 b  must get the same meaning as in item 8 a   that is to say  if the. construction had facilities open to sky the whole of the  activity area  must. 55   it is extremely difficult to accept the contention that the. categorization under items 8  a  and 8  b  has no bearing on the nature and. character of the project and is based purely on the built up area  a building. and construction project is nothing but addition of structures over the land. a township project is the development of a new area for residential. commercial or industrial use  a township project is different both. quantitatively and qualitatively from a mere building and construction. project  further  an area development project may be connected with the. township development project and may be its first 54 stage when grounds are. cleared  roads and pathways are laid out and provisions are made for drainage. sewage  electricity and telephone lines and the whole range of other civic. infrastructure  or an area development project may be completely independent. standard and in that case the project by virtue of sheer magnitude would. qualify as township development project  to that limited extent there may be a. quantitative correlation between items 8 a  and 8 b   but it must be realized. that the converse of the illustration given by mr  bhushan may not be true. for example  a project which is by its nature and character an  area. development project  would not become a  building and construction project. simply because it falls short of the threshold mark under item 8  b  but comes. within the area specified in item 8  a   the essential difference between. items 8 a  and 8 b  lies not only in the different magnitudes but in the. difference in the nature and character of the projects enumerated there under. 55. 57   in light of the above discussion it is difficult to see the project in. question as a  building and construction project   applying the test of. dominant purpose or dominant nature  of the project or the  common parlance. test  i e  how a common person using it and enjoying its facilities would view. it  the project can only be categorized under item 8 b  of the schedule as a. township and area development project   but under that category it does not. come up to the threshold marker inasmuch as the total area of the project. 33 43 hectares  is less than 50 hectares and its built up area even if the. hard landscaped area and the covered areas are put together comes to. 1 05 544 49 square metres  i e   much below the threshold marker of 1 50 000. square metres. 58   the inescapable conclusion  therefore  is that the project does not fall. within the ambit of the eia notification s o  1533 e  dated september 14. 2006  this is not to say that this is the ideal or a very happy outcome but. that is how the notification is framed and taking any other view would be. doing gross violence to the scheme of the notification. 59   since it is held that the project does not come within the ambit of the. notification  the other three arguments based on the activity area  56 the. application of general condition and the application of the office memorandum. dated december 2  2009 become irrelevant and need not be gone into in this. case. the project and the okhla bird sanctuary. 60   mr  bhushan next raised the issue of the project being located virtually. adjoining the okhla bird sanctuary  the very close proximity of the project. site to the bird sanctuary actually raises issues of serious concern and poses. a dilemma  on the one hand the project proponents can not be said to have. broken any law or violated a definite order or direction of the court but on. the other hand the project may possibly cause serious and irreparable harm to. the bird sanctuary. failed to take any steps in this regard even after the order of this court. weeks  the moef made the accusation that in the case of the present project. sensitive zones  conceded that  till eco sensitive zone is declared the. construction work did not seem to violate any law act. but it went on to say that having regard to its location the project was. better suited to be made part of extension of the bird sanctuary. 58. 63   the state government of uttar pradesh took the stand that no proposals. were sent from its side because the moef failed to issue the necessary. guidelines for the purpose  on behalf of the state of up  reference was made. to a meeting called by the director general of forests and special secretary. is of the view that in the absence of a decision notification  presently there. is no legal restriction against the implementation of the project on the. ground that the project is adjacent to the okhla bird sanctuary. 33   however  it has to be borne in mind that the project area is hardly at a. distance of 50 meter from the okhla bird sanctuary and that in all probability. the project site would have fallen in the eco sensitive zone  had a timely. decision in this regard been taken by the state government  moef. 65   the report of the cec succinctly sums up the situation  though everyone. excepting the project proponents  views the construction of the project. practically adjoining the bird sanctuary as a potential hazard to the. sensitive and fragile ecological balance of the sanctuary there is no law to. stop it  this unhappy and anomalous situation has arisen simply because. despite directions by this court the authorities in the central and the state. governments have so far not been able to evolve a principle to notify the. buffer zones around sanctuaries and national parks to protect the sensitive. and delicate ecological balance required for the sanctuaries. 66   but the absence of a statute will not preclude this court from examining. the project s effects on the environment with particular reference to the. okhla bird sanctuary  for  in the jurisprudence developed by this court. environment is not merely a statutory issue. environment is one of the facets of the right to life guaranteed under article. 21 of the constitution1  environment is  therefore  a matter 1 m c  mehta. anr  v  union of india   ors   air 1987 sc 985 m c  mehta v  union of india. ors     1987  4 scc 463   cgi bin lawcite cit  281987 29 204 20scc 20463  m c. step in  the question of the likelihood of the project causing any adverse. effects on the okhla bird sanctuary must  therefore  be examined from this. angle. 67   we may note here that mr  venugopal presented before us some photographs. trying to show the situation on the western boundary of the okhla bird. sanctuary at its delhi end  in the photographs there is a road  about forty to. sixty feet wide   the kalindikunj irrigation colony batla road  running right. next to the wire mesh fencing of the sanctuary  next to the road is a long row. of cheek by jowl concrete structures houses that seem to lean against one. another  the road has the bustling traffic of delhi where all kinds of. vehicles  and cattle   appear jostling for space  the situation on the western. boundary of the sanctuary is indeed deplorable but that is no reason to. strangulate the sanctuary from the noida side as well. the project and the amelioration measures to safeguard the adjacent bird. sanctuary  in pursuance of the court s directions the moef had asked the. project proponents to have the environmental impact assessment of the project. made of the impact assessment of the project  one is a joint study prepared by. clearly shows that the construction and felling of trees in the project site. has no impact on obs. 7 it appears that the existence of high tension line along the boundary wall. of the project site before the start of the project might have been a barrier. for movement of the birds from obs as high electro magnetic influence would. restrict the movement of birds  hence  the construction and the felling of. trees in the project site has minimal influence on the obs. 64 in view of the above  we are of the opinion that felling of trees and. construction have no perceptible impact on the obs habitat. afforestation in and around the project site. reviewed the project in question in light of the aforementioned reports and. made a number of recommendations  paper book volume iii  page 32  that would. form part of this judgment. 75   it is significant to note that none of the expert bodies has taken the. view that the project is so calamitous or ruinous for the bird sanctuary that. it needs to be altogether scrapped in order to save the sanctuary. the expert bodies have given recommendations which allow the 66 completion of. towards the okhla bird sanctuary on the western side of the project area  any. construction work should commence only on completion of the planting of the. trees. 77   in order to ensure full compliance with the recommendations of the expert. bodies  which form part of the judgment  and the directions of this court  the. construction of the project needs to be overseen by an expert committee  one. member of the committee  preferably an ornithologist will be nominated by the. moef  the other member will be nominated by the cec in consultation with the. 78   it is made clear that the above directions are given in the peculiar. facts of this case and nothing said in the judgment shall form precedent when. the court is hearing the matter of the  buffer zones. 79   before putting down the records of the case a few observations may not be. under items 8 a  and 8 b  of the schedule to the notification need to be. described with greater precision and clarity and the definition of built up. area with facilities open to the sky needs to be freed from its present. ambiguity and vagueness  the question of application of the general condition. to the projects activities listed in the schedule also needs to be put beyond. any debate or dispute  we would also like to point out that the environmental. impact studies in this case were not conducted either by the moef or any. organization under it or even by any agencies appointed by it  all the three. studies that were finally placed before the expert appraisal committee and. which this court has also taken into consideration  were made at the behest of. the project proponents and by agencies of their choice  this court would have. moef or by any organization under it or at least by agencies appointed and. although there appears to be no perceptible impact  as a precautionary. approach  we suggest following measures for the overall improvement of the. promising site for water birds which prefer shallow water or grass growth. it is suggested that at the periphery of the obs  fence wherever not existing. be created and the breach in the existing fence be mended on priority. 1  eliciting support from the government of delhi for the conservation of. obs  as the obs is a interstate protected area having open access from all. side it is imperative that the government of delhi may also be persuaded to. system for the nearby residential and commercial areas. iv  treated waste water from sector 54 sewerage treatment plant is proposed. for horticulture purposes  it must also be utilised as much as possible for. xv  a monitoring committee should be constituted for overseeing the project. so as to ensure effective implementation and compliance to environmental.

before us being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with a judgment. and order dated 14 2 2005 passed by the high court of punjab and haryana in. civil revision petition no 5999 of 2003 whereby and whereunder the revision. application filed by the first respondent herein was allowed. 3   appellant filed a civil suit on or about 6 4 1985  summons of the suit. were served upon the first respondent  he did not appear  an ex parte decree. was passed against him on 19 2 1986  an application for mutation on the basis. thereof was filed which was allowed on 07 03 1996  allegedly  the first. respondent having come to know about passing of the said ex parte decree on. 03 02 1997  filed an application on 07 02 1997 for setting aside the same  in. terms of order ix rule 13 of the code of civil procedure  the learned trial. judge  by reason of an order dated 28 07 2000  dismissed the said application. inter alia  holding that summons had been duly served upon the first. respondent  it was furthermore noticed that the first respondent herein  while. examining himself in the said proceedings under order ix rule 13 of the code. of civil procedure in his cross examination  admitted that one and a half year. prior to filing of the said application  he and his brother approached dharam. singh for getting the judgment and decree set aside but he negated their plea. 4   an appeal was preferred thereagainst  the appellate court also affirmed. the said finding holding. also affixed on his house  this report is duly attested by clerk of court as. per ex r4 b and affidavit has also been given by jogi ram process server and. affidavit has also been given by jogi ramprocess server and subhash was to. village also  the defendant failed to appear in court as per ex r1  ex r2 is. the report of ram mehar  process server who got effected the munadi. no doubt nand lal chjowkidar has denied his thumb impression but it carried no. refusal by the defendant to appear in the court but as well as by getting the. defendant served through munadi  since the defendant intentionally did not. appear in the court so the learned trial court has rightly passed the ex parte. judgment and decree dated 19 2 86. 13   admittedly the decree under challenge was passed in the year 1986 while. the present application for setting aside the ex parte judgment and decree was. filed on 6 2 97 i e  almost after eleven years of passing of the impugned. the defendant has tried to prove that he came to know recently about the. process served has categorically stated that about 1 1 2 years back he. alongwith his brother  went to dharam singh and dharam singh told them that. findings of the learned trial court recorded under issue no 1 and 2 are hereby. affirmed and these issues are decided against the appellant defendant and in. 5   the revision application filed thereagainst by the first respondent herein. was allowed by the high court  the high court in the impugned judgment opined. that the appellant had played fraud on the court as neither the summons were. properly served  nor the publication was made in the newspapers  order v rule. 19a of the code of civil procedure  which  according to the high court  could. have been taken recourse to  had also not been resorted to  adverse comments. were also made by the high court in regard to the application for mutation. filed by the appellant only after 10 years  i e   in the year 1996. 6   the approach of the high court  in our opinion  was not correct. there exists a presumption that the official act was been done in ordinary. course of business  admittedly  an ex parte decree was passed  defendant for. served on him or he had sufficient cause for remaining absent on the date. parte or to where the summons re hear an appeal decreed or notice was not duly. or heard ex parte  served  when the applicant had explanation  for the. knowledge of the purpose of this article  decree. substituted service under rule 20 of order v of the code of civil procedure. 1908  5 of 1908  shall not be deemed to be due service. 8   thus  even assuming for the sake of argument that no proper step was taken. by the appellant herein for service of summons upon the respondent and or the. service of summons was irregular  evidently  it was for the defendant. respondent to establish as to when he came to know about the passing of the ex. parte decree  even in his cross examination  the first respondent has. categorically admitted that he had approached the appellant herein for not. giving effect thereto one and half year prior to filing of the application. filed one and a half year after the first respondent came to know about. passing of the ex parte decree in the suit  the said application evidently was. barred by limitation. counsels fee assessed at rs 10 000    rupees ten thousand only.
[Ratio of the decision] decree  so far as the delay in filing the application is concerned  no doubt. decision of the case but this version is not tanable when pw1 ram mehar. they have got no concern with the plot in question and that he would not set. aside the decree  he has also stated that he has told his relatives that 10 11. days prior filing this application  this clearly shows that the defendant was. well aware of the decree in question and he can file the present application. within one month of the passing of the decree  he is to explain each days. delay  so it can be safely eld that the application is time barred  thus  the. favour of the respondents plaintiffs. and  thus  he must be deemed to have knowledge about passing of the said ex. parte decree  the period of limitation would  thus  be reckoned from that day. 9   in terms of section 3 of the  limitation act. 1963  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act la1963133    no court. shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or application if the same has. been filed after expiry of the period of limitation  the high court could not.

satisfactory levels of quality in the functioning of higher education. institutions  there have been criticisms that the country has permitted the. mushrooming of institutions of higher education with fancy programme and. substandard facilities and consequent dilution of standards  to address the. issues of deterioration in quality  the national policy on education  1986. and the plan of action

council. outsourcing its statutory functions in the absence of statutory authorisation. for sub delegation of the delegated power. iii  by giving a retrospective effect to the regulations and  iv  due to non. in absence of express authorisation by the parent act  therefore  regulation. 8 4  ultra vires the ncte act  1993 and article 14 of the constitution of. ii  the ncte act  1993 does not authorise the  council  to frame regulations. retrospectively  in absence of such power the delegatee the  council  cannot. make subordinate legislation retrospectively  the requirement  therefore. contemplated under regulation 8 5  being ex  facie retrospective  taking away. the right of the appellants to continue 4 with the additional seats of b ed. course  is violative of article 19 1  g  of the constitution. regulation 8 4  does not amount to delegation of any of the powers of the. council   it merely imposed a  condition  required for opening a new course. or intake for students as empowered under the ncte act  1993  the regulation. 8 5  does not amount to giving effect from retrospective date  as such power. recognised course during the period from 21st july  2006 to 10th december. grade b as was stipulated under regulation 8 4   since  the conditions under. regulation 8 3  and 8 4  were brought into force by regulations  2007  it was. decided that those institutions which have been granted recognition for. enhancement of seats without insisting upon the condition of having accredited. with the naac  have been directed to get themselves accredited with naac. ii  the condition stipulated under regulation 8 4  does not amount to sub. delegation of power but merely a  condition  laid down for grant of. recognition of new course or for enhancement of additional intake in the. existing course  so far as processing  scrutinising and deciding upon an. application for recognition permission for conducting teacher training course. is concerned  it is the  council  and its regional committees 6 which are. under the act. iii  the regulation 8 5  only provides that the institutions who have been. same is prospective in nature. parties  it would be convenient to notice the relevant provisions of the ncte. act  1993 and the regulations framed thereunder. regulations. 16   under section 32 the  council  is empowered to make regulations not. in the official gazette  make regulations not inconsistent with the provisions. of this act and the rules made thereunder  generally to carry out the. education  recognition norms   procedure  amendment  regulations  2006. 2   a pplicability  1  these regulations shall be applicable to all matters. pertaining to grant of recognition  permission to conduct a secondary teacher. accreditation body  consequently  the naac was established in 1994 with its. stage process which is a combination of self study and peer review  as. follows. 1  the preparation and submission of a self study report by the unit of. assessment   2  the on site visit of the peer team for validation of the self. study report and for recommending the assessment outcome to the naac. 3  the final decision by the executive committee of the naac. 13 the self study report validated by peers is the backbone of the whole. exercise  manuals have been developed to suit different units of higher. education  with detailed guidelines on the preparation of the self study. report and the other aspects of assessment and accreditation. 24   section 12 of ncte act  1993 deals with function of the council  under. naac are to ensure and assure the quality of teachers education institutions. in the country complementary to each other  combining the teacher education. for self appraisal of teacher education institutions   the aforesaid facts can. be noticed from the documents supplied by the parties which prescribe the. methodology of assessment required to be followed by the naac as per strategic. plans  policies and memorandum of understanding reached between naac and the. council. 26   before we decide on the validity of regulations 8 4  and 8 5   we must. first deal with the law as laid down by this court in different decisions with. regard to the power of a delegate of a legislature  such as the council in. in the sense of not being reasonable  but in the sense that it is manifestly. arbitrary. 28   again in clariant international ltd  and another v  securities   exchange. council  in other words  if the regulation 8 4  is in broad conformity with. the objects and policy of the act and is not in conflict with any statutory or. constitutional provisions  the regulation made by the delegate  namely  the. council  will have to be held to be valid. 31   we find that the ncte act  1993 was enacted with the object  i  to. achieve planned and co ordinated development of the teacher education system. throughout the country and  ii  for laying down the proper maintenance of. norms and standards in the teacher education system  the  council  has been. for which the  council  is empowered under section 32 2  h  to prescribe. condition  for grant of such permission and recognition. 32   the  council  is also empowered to cause inspection of any institution. through any person under section 13 of the ncte act  1993. 17. 33   combined reading of section 12 k   section 15 and section 32 2  h   makes. it clear that the  council  is empowered to frame a regulation laying down. prescribe the such  condition   as it deems fit and proper with only rider. that such  condition  should not be against any of the provisions of the ncte. particular subject obtained from a recognised university  to grant recognition. to start a new course  if such condition is prescribed it will not amount to. the expression  retrospective  as under. 19   every sovereign legislature possesses the right to make retrospective. legislation  the power to make laws includes the power to give it. retrospective effect  craies on statute law  7th edn   at p  387 defines. retrospective statutes in the following words. a statute is to be deemed to be retrospective  which takes away or impairs. 37 a  pp  224 25  defines a  retrospective or retroactive law  as one which. retroactivity  is a term often used by lawyers but rarely defined  on. analysis it soon becomes apparent  19 moreover  that it is used to cover at. least two distinct concepts  the first  which may be called  true. retroactivity   consists in the application of a new rule of law to an act or. transaction which was completed before the rule was promulgated  the second. concept  which will be referred to as  quasi retroactivity   occurs when a new. rule of law is applied to an act or transaction in the process of. completion     the foundation of these concepts is the distinction between. completed and pending transactions      t c  hartley  foundations of european. community law  p  129  1981. retrospective   looking back  contemplating what is past. having operation from a past time. retrospective  is somewhat ambiguous and that good deal of confusion has been. caused by the fact that it is used in more senses than one  in general. however  the courts regard as retrospective any statute which operates on. cases or facts coming into existence before its commencement in the sense that. it affects  even if for the future only  the character or consequences of. transactions previously entered into or of other past conduct  thus  a statute. is not retrospective merely because it affects existing rights  nor is it. retrospective merely because a part of the requisite for its action is drawn. from a time antecedent to its passing    vol  44  halsbury s laws of england. 4th edn   p  570  para 921. therefore  it is to be seen as to whether regulation 8 5  takes away any right. of the appellants or impairs any vested right acquired by appellants under the. existing law or has created any new obligation in their part. 36   regulations 8 3  and 8 4  were already in vogue since 13th january  2006. when regulations dated 27th december  2005 came into effect  as per regulation. 8 3  only after three academic sessions an institution was eligible to apply. for enhancement of intake of students in the course  under regulation 8 4. only such institution which had accredited itself with the naac with a 20. letter grade b  was entitled to apply for enhancement of intake of students in. aforesaid the regulation 8 5  cannot be held to be retrospective  the second. question is  thereby  answered in negative against the appellants. 40   further  as plain reading of the regulations 8 3   8 4  and 8 5  makes it. clear that right of exemption  if any  accrued to an institution in view of. note  23 below regulation 3 of amended regulations 2006  has not been taken.

learned counsel appearing for the state and the employees union submits. that by virtue of section 3 of the working journalists act  the provisions of. i d  act as such have been made applicable  the recommendations of the wage. board is an award  the award has not been implemented in its letter and. spirit  a section of the employees has been discriminated and thus  the. prosecution is

confiscated and. if that was so  section 58  delhi excise act would not apply with regard to. the vehicle in question and the procedure that was to be followed regarding. the vehicle was to be found

commissioner  on. production of the seized property  the deputy commissioner  if satisfied that. the offence under the act has been committed  may order confiscation of such. property  therefore  under the scheme of the act any vehicle used for carrying. the intoxicant is liable to be confiscated and on seizure of the vehicle. transporting the intoxicant  the same is required to be produced before the. deputy commissioner  who in turn has been conferred with the power of its. confiscation. contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force  have. jurisdiction to make any order with regard to such property ” according to. this section  notwithstanding anything contrary contained in any other law for. the time being in force  no court shall have jurisdiction to make any order. with regard to the property used in committing any offence and seized under. the act. it is relevant here to state that in the present case  the high court  while. releasing the vehicle on security has exercised its power under section 451 of. the code  true it is that where any property is produced by an officer before. a criminal court during an inquiry or trial under this section  the court may. make any direction as it thinks fit for the proper custody of such property. pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial  as the case may be  at the. the code  make an order for the disposal of the property produced before it. and make such other direction as it may think necessary  further  where the. property is not produced before a criminal court in an inquiry or trial  the. magistrate is empowered under section 457 of the code to make such order as it. thinks fit  in our opinion  the general provision of section 451 of the code. with regard to the custody and disposal of the property or for that matter by. destruction  confiscation or delivery to any person entitled to possession. thereof under section 452 of the code or that of section 457 authorising a. magistrate to make an order for disposal of property  if seized by an officer. and not produced before a criminal court during an inquiry or trial  however. has to yield where a statute makes a special provision with regard to its. confiscation and disposal  we have referred to the scheme of the act and from. that it is evident that the vehicle seized has to be produced before the. deputy commissioner  who in turn has been conferred with the power of its. confiscation or release to its rightful owner  the requirement of production. 457 of the code must yield to the provisions of the act and there is no escape. from the conclusion that the magistrate or for that matter the high court. while dealing with the case of seizure of vehicle under the act  has any power. to pass an order dealing with the interim custody of the vehicle on security. or its release thereof  the view which we have taken finds support from a. giving overriding effect to the provisions in the act over other statutes and. laws  the necessary corollary of such provisions is that in a case where the. authorized officer is empowered to confiscate the seized forest produce on. being satisfied that an offence under the act has been committed thereof the. general power vested in the magistrate for dealing with interim. custody release of the seized materials under crpc has to give way  the. magistrate while dealing with a case of any seizure of forest produce under. the act should examine whether the power to confiscate the seized forest. produce is vested in the authorized officer under the act and if he finds that. such power is vested in the authorized officer then he has no power to pass an. order dealing with interim custody release of the seized material  this  in. our view  will help in proper implementation of provisions of the special act. and will help in advancing the purpose and object of the statute  if in such. cases power to grant interim custody release of the seized forest produce is. vested in the magistrate then it will be defeating the very scheme of the act. such a consequence is to be avoided. 24   from the statutory provisions and the analysis made in the foregoing. paragraphs the position that emerges is that the learned magistrate and the. learned sessions judge were right in holding that on facts and in the. circumstances of the case  it is the authorized officer who is vested with the. power to pass order of interim custody of the vehicle and not the magistrate. the high court was in error in taking a view to the contrary and in setting. aside the orders passed by the magistrate and the sessions judge on that. basis ” from a conspectus of what we have observed above  the impugned order. of the high court is found to be vulnerable and  therefore  the same cannot be. allowed to stand. to put the record straight it is relevant here to state that the counsel for. the respondent had not  and in our opinion rightly  challenged the vires of. the provisions of the act in view of the decision of this court in the case of. provision existing in the rajasthan excise act.

j. petitioner happens to be the husband of respondent no  1  lata nandlal badwaik. and alleged to be the father of girl child netra alias neha nandlal badwaik. respondent no  2  herein  the marriage between them was solemnized on 30th of. june  1990 at chandrapur  wife filed an application for maintenance under. section 125 of the code of criminal procedure  but the same was dismissed by. the learned magistrate by order dated 10th december  1993  thereafter  the. wife resorted to a fresh proceeding under section 125 of the code of criminal. procedure  hereinafter referred to as the ‘code’  claiming maintenance for. herself and her daughter  inter alia  alleging that she started living with. her husband from 20th of june  1996 and stayed with him for about two years. and during that period got pregnant  she was sent for delivery at her parents’. place where she gave birth to a girl child  the respondent no  2 herein. petitioner husband resisted the claim and alleged that the assertion of the. wife that she stayed with him since 20th of june  1996 is false  he denied. that respondent no  2 is his daughter  after 1991  according to the husband. he had no physical relationship with his wife  the learned magistrate accepted. the plea of the wife and granted maintenance at the rate of rs 900   per month. to the wife and at the rate of rs 500   per month to the daughter  the. challenge to the said order in revision has failed so also a petition under. section 482 of the code  challenging those orders. it is against these orders  the petitioner has preferred this special leave. petition. leave granted. taking note of the challenge to the paternity of the child  this court by. order dated 10th of january  2011 passed the following order. “…………however  the petitioner husband had challenged the paternity of the child. and had claimed that no maintenance ought to have been awarded to the child. the petitioner had also applied for referring the child for dna test  which. was refused  it is against the said order of refusal that the present special. leave was filed and the same prayer for conducting the dna test was made. 2011  we had agreed to allow the petitioner’s prayer for conducting dna test. for ascertaining the paternity of the child. we have since been informed by counsel for the parties that a forensic science. laboratory in nagpur conducts the very same test  as has been asked for  by. the petitioner  accordingly  we direct the petitioner nandlal wasudeo badwaik. and the respondent no  1 ms  lata nandlal badwaik to make a joint application. to the forensic science laboratory  nagpur  situated at jail road  dhantoli. for conducting such test  the petitioner  as well as the respondent no  1. shall present themselves at the laboratory with respondent no  2 for the said. purpose on the date to be fixed by the laboratory  and  thereafter  the. laboratory is directed to send the result of such test to this court within. four weeks thereafter  the expenses for the test to be conducted shall be. borne by the petitioner husband ” in the light of the aforesaid order  the. regional forensic science laboratory  nagpur has submitted the result of dna. testing and opined that appellant “nandlal vasudev badwaik is excluded to be. the biological father of netra alias neha nandlal badwaik”  respondent no  2. herein. respondents  not being satisfied with the aforesaid report  made a request for. re test  the said prayer of the respondents was accepted and this court by. order dated 22nd of july  2011 gave the following direction. “despite the fact that the report of the dna test conducted at the regional. forensic science laboratory  state of maharashtra  nagpur 12  indicates that. the petitioner is not the biological father of the respondent no  2  on the. the report which has been filed. accordingly  we direct that a further dna test be conducted at the central. forensic laboratory  ministry of home affairs  government of india at. hyderabad and for the said purpose the parties are directed to appear before. the laboratory on 24th august  2011 at 11 00 a m ” as directed  the central. forensic science laboratory  hyderabad submitted its report and on that basis. opined that the appellant  “nandlal wasudeo badwaik can be excluded from being. the biological father of miss neha nandlal badwaik”  respondent no  2 herein. at the outset  mr  manish pitale appearing for the respondents submits that. the appellant having failed to establish that he had no access to his wife at. any time when she could have begotten respondent no  2  the direction for dna. test…………… ” yet another decision on which reliance has been placed is the. ms  desai submits that in view of the opinions  based on dna profiling that. appellant is not the biological father  he cannot be fastened with the.
[Ratio of the decision] before us  on 8th november  2010 we had accordingly  directed the petitioner. husband to deposit all dues  both arrear and current  in respect of the. maintenance awarded to the wife and child to enable us to consider the prayer. for holding of such dna test  such deposit having been made on 3rd january. prayer made on behalf of the respondents for a re test  we are of the view. that such a prayer may be allowed having regard to the serious consequences of. test ought not to have been given  in view of the aforesaid he submits that. the result of such a test is fit to be ignored. time when the modern scientific advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid  dna. as well as ribonucleic acid  rna  tests were not even in contemplation of the. legislature  the result of a genuine dna test is said to be scientifically. accurate  but even that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of. section 112 of the evidence act e g  if a husband and wife were living. together during the time of conception but the dna test revealed that the. child was not born to the husband  the conclusiveness in law would remain. irrebuttable  this may look hard from the point of view of the husband who. would be compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he may be. innocent  but even in such a case the law leans in favour of the innocent. child from being bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living together. during the time of conception  hence the question regarding the degree of. proof of non access for rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in the. light of what is meant by access or non access as delineated above   see kamti. have been ordered is academic  we find substance in the submission of ms. desai  fact of the matter is that this court not only once  but twice gave. directions for dna test  the respondents  in fact  had not opposed the prayer. of dna test when such a prayer was being considered  it is only after the. reports of the dna test had been received  which was adverse to the. respondents  that they are challenging it on the ground that such a test ought. not to have been directed  we cannot go into the validity of the orders passed. by a coordinate bench of this court at this stage  it has attained finality. hence  we do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for. the respondents  as regards the decision of this court in the cases of goutam. kundu  supra   banarsi dass  supra  and bhabani prasad jena  supra   the same. have no bearing in the facts and circumstances of the case  in all these. cases  the court was considering as to whether facts of those cases justify. passing of an order for dna test  when the order for dna test has already been. passed  at this stage  we are not concerned with this issue and we have to. proceed on an assumption that a valid direction for dna test was given. liability to pay maintenance to the girl child born to the wife  mr. pitale  however  submits that the marriage between the parties has not been. dissolved  and the birth of the child having taken place during the. subsistence of a valid marriage and the husband having access to the wife. conclusively prove that the girl child is the legitimate daughter of the. appellant  according to him  the dna test cannot rebut the conclusive. presumption envisaged under section 112 of the evidence act  according to him. respondent no  2  therefore  has to be held to be the appellant’s legitimate. daughter  in support of the submission  reliance has been placed on a decision. “10  ………the result of a genuine dna test is said to be scientifically. accurate  but even that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of. section 112 of the act e g  if a husband and wife were living together during. the time of conception but the dna test revealed that the child was not born. to the husband  the conclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable  this may. look hard from the point of view of the husband who would be compelled to bear. the fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent  but even in such a case. the law leans in favour of the innocent child from being bastardised if his. before we proceed to consider the rival submissions  we deem it necessary to. understand what exactly dna test is and ultimately its accuracy  all living. beings are composed of cells which are the smallest and basic unit of life  an. average human body has trillion of cells of different sizes  dna. deoxyribonucleic acid   which is found in the chromosomes of the cells of. accurate. it is nobody’s case that the result of the dna test is not genuine and. therefore  we have to proceed on an assumption that the result of the dna test. is accurate  the dna test reports show that the appellant is not the. biological father of the girl child. now we have to consider as to whether the dna test would be sufficient to hold. that the appellant is not the biological father of respondent no. 2  in the face of what has been provided under section 112 of the evidence. that the child is a legitimate child of the man to whom the lady giving birth. is married  the provision makes the legitimacy of the child to be a conclusive. proof  if the conditions aforesaid are satisfied  it can be denied only if it. is shown that the parties to the marriage have no access to each other at any. time when the child could have been begotten  here  in the present case  the. wife had pleaded that the husband had access to her and  in fact  the child. was born in the said wedlock  but the husband had specifically pleaded that. after his wife left the matrimonial home  she did not return and thereafter. he had no access to her  the wife has admitted that she had left the. matrimonial home but again joined her husband  unfortunately  none of the. courts below have given any finding with regard to this plea of the husband. that he had or had not any access to his wife at the time when the child could. have been begotten. as stated earlier  the dna test is an accurate test and on that basis it is. clear that the appellant is not the biological father of the girl  child. however  at the same time  the condition precedent for invocation of section. 112 of the evidence act has been established and no finding with regard to the. plea of the husband that he had no access to his wife at the time when the. child could have been begotten has been recorded. admittedly  the child has been born during the continuance of a valid. marriage  therefore  the provisions of section 112 of the evidence act. conclusively prove that respondent no  2 is the daughter of the appellant. at the same time  the dna test reports  based on scientific analysis  in no. in such circumstance  which would give way to the other is a complex question. posed before us. we may remember that section 112 of the evidence act was enacted at a time. when the modern scientific advancement and dna test were not even in. contemplation of the legislature  the result of dna test is said to be. scientifically accurate  although section 112 raises a presumption of. conclusive proof on satisfaction of the conditions enumerated therein but the. same is rebuttable  the presumption may afford legitimate means of arriving at. an affirmative legal conclusion  while the truth or fact is known  in our. opinion  there is no need or room for any presumption  where there is evidence. to the contrary  the presumption is rebuttable and must yield to proof. interest of justice is best served by ascertaining the truth and the court. should be furnished with the best available science and may not be left to. bank upon presumptions  unless science has no answer to the facts in issue  in. our opinion  when there is a conflict between a conclusive proof envisaged. under law and a proof based on scientific advancement accepted by the world. community to be correct  the latter must prevail over the former. we must understand the distinction between a legal fiction and the presumption. of a fact  legal fiction assumes existence of a fact which may not really. exist  however presumption of a fact depends on satisfaction of certain. circumstances  those circumstances logically would lead to the fact sought to. be presumed  section 112 of the evidence act does not create a legal fiction. but provides for presumption. the husband’s plea that he had no access to the wife when the child was. begotten stands proved by the dna test report and in the face of it  we cannot. compel the appellant to bear the fatherhood of a child  when the scientific. reports prove to the contrary  we are conscious that an innocent child may not. be bastardized as the marriage between her mother and father was subsisting at. the time of her birth  but in view of the dna test reports and what we have. observed above  we cannot forestall the consequence  it is denying the truth. “truth must triumph” is the hallmark of justice. as regards the authority of this court in the case of kamti devi  supra   this. court on appreciation of evidence came to the conclusion that the husband had. no opportunity whatsoever to have liaison with the wife. there was no dna test held in the case  in the said background i e  non. access of the husband with the wife  this court held that the result of dna. test “is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of section 112 of the. act”  the judgment has to be understood in the factual scenario of the said. case  the said judgment has not held that dna test is to be ignored. in fact  this court has taken note of the fact that dna test is scientifically. accurate  we hasten to add that in none of the cases referred to above  this. court was confronted with a situation in which dna test report  in fact  was. in the result  we allow this appeal  set aside the impugned judgment so far as. it directs payment of maintenance to respondent no  2  however  we direct that. the payments already made shall not be recovered from the respondents.

[Ratio of the decision] help   liiofindia help cases html. 2  the following issues arise for consideration. a  whether the office of the chief post master general has shown sufficient. cause for condoning the delay of 427 days in filing slps before this court. depending on the outcome of the above issue  other issues to be considered. are. 1 b  whether the impugned advertisement inserted in the reader s digest issue. of december  2005 is in conformity with the requirement of law. c  whether the department has made out a case for interference under article. 136 of the constitution of india to reopen concurrent findings of fact. rendered by the high court. reasons  we permitted the appellant postal department to file a better. affidavit explaining the reasons for the same  pursuant to the same  an. decisions of this court and the appellant being a government department  delay. may be condoned and an opportunity may be given to put forth their stand as to. the impugned judgment of the high court  7  before going into the reasons. furnished by the department for the delay  let us consider various decisions. following principles    1   ordinarily a litigant does not stand to benefit by. other side cannot claim to have vested right in injustice being done because. of a non deliberate delay. 5   there is no presumption that delay is occasioned deliberately  or on. account of culpable negligence  or on account of mala fides  a litigant does. removing injustice and is expected to do so. are    15   in litigations to which government is a party there is yet another. aspect which  perhaps  cannot be ignored  if appeals brought by government are. lost for such defaults  no person is individually affected  but what  in the. ultimate analysis  suffers is public interest  the decisions of government are. collective and institutional decisions and do 7 not share the characteristics. of decisions of private individuals. 17   therefore  in assessing what  in a particular case  constitutes. sufficient cause  for purposes of section 5  it might  perhaps  be somewhat. unrealistic to exclude from the considerations that go into the judicial. verdict  these factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the. functioning of the government  governmental decisions are proverbially slow. encumbered  as they are  by a considerable degree of procedural red tape in. the process of their making. considering the peculiar facts  namely  the change of government pleader who. had taken away the certified copy after he ceases to be in office  the high. court condoned the delay which was affirmed by this court. through all the factual details  we are of the view that there is no quarrel. about the propositions inferred therein  however  considering the peculiar. facts and circumstances of each case  this court either condoned the delay or. upheld the order of the high court condoning the delay in filing appeal by the. state  while keeping those principles in mind  let us consider the reasonings. placed by the postal department with regard to the same. 9  in view of the stand taken by the postal department as to the reasons for. the delay and the serious objections of the respondents  it is desirable to. extract the entire statement as placed in the form of  better affidavit  by. 2  on the last date of hearing i e  05 12 2011 this hon ble court was pleased. the matters relating to government are required to be considered at various. levels and then only a decision is taken. kind attention of this hon ble court to the views expressed by this hon ble. court that liberal approach may be adopted and that the court should not take. too strict and pedantic stand which will cause injustice while considering the. are lost for such default  no person is individually affected but what in the. ultimate analysis suffers  is public interest  the expression  sufficient. on account of which special leave petition could not be filed within the. time   10  before considering whether the reasons for justifying such a huge. delay are acceptable or not  it is also useful to refer the decisions relied. commissioner of wealth tax  bombay  the explanation for the delay had been set. out in petitioner s own words as under. which binds everybody  we cannot find any way of granting relief  it is true. that government should not be treated as any other 15 private litigant as. indeed  in the case of the former the decisions to present and prosecute. appeals are not individual but are institutional decisions necessarily bogged. down by the proverbial red tape  but there are limits to this also  even with. all this latitude  the explanation offered for the delay in this case merely. serves to aggravate the attitude of indifference of the revenue in protecting. its common interests  the affidavit is again one of the stereotyped affidavits. making it susceptible to the criticism that the revenue does not seem to. attach any importance to the need for promptitude even where it affects its. own interest. emphasis supplied  ii  in pundlik jalam patil  dead  by lrs  vs  executive. engineer  jalgaon medium project and another   2008  17 sc 448  the question. was whether the respondent executive engineer  jalgaon medium project had. his jurisprudence states that the laws come to the assistance of the vigilant. and not of the sleepy. 30   public interest undoubtedly is a paramount consideration in exercising. acquisition  as the case may be  should not be allowed to indulge in any act. to unsettle the settled legal rights accrued in law by resorting to avoidable. litigation unless the claimants are guilty of deriving benefit to which they. are otherwise not entitled  in any fraudulent manner  one should not forget. the basic fact that what is acquired is not the land but the livelihood of the. landlosers  these public interest parameters ought to be kept in mind by the. courts while exercising the discretion dealing with the application filed. under section 5 of the  limitation. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act la1963133    dragging the. landlosers to courts of law years after the termination of legal proceedings. would not serve any public interest  settled rights cannot be lightly. interfered with by condoning inordinate delay without there being any proper. explanation of such delay on the ground of involvement of public revenue  it. serves no public interest. 11  we have already extracted the reasons as mentioned in the  better. affidavit  sworn by mr  aparajeet pattanayak  ssrm  air mail sorting division. new delhi  it is relevant to note that in the said affidavit  the department. has itself mentioned and is aware of the date of the judgment of the division. bench of the high court in lpa nos  418 and 1006 of 2007 as 11 09 2009  even. neither the department nor the person in charge has filed any explanation for. not applying the certified copy within the prescribed period  the other dates. mentioned in the affidavit which we have already extracted  clearly show that. there was delay at every stage and except mentioning the dates of receipt of. the file and the decision taken  there is no explanation as to why such delay. had occasioned  though it was stated by the department that the delay was due. to unavoidable circumstances and genuine difficulties  the fact remains that. from day one the department or the person persons concerned have not evinced. diligence in 18 prosecuting the matter to this court by taking appropriate. steps  12  it is not in dispute that the person s  concerned were well aware. or conversant with the issues involved including the prescribed period of. limitation for taking up the matter by way of filing a special leave petition. in this court  they cannot claim that they have a separate period of. limitation when the department was possessed with competent persons familiar. with court proceedings  in the absence of plausible and acceptable. explanation  we are posing a question why the delay is to be condoned. mechanically merely because the government or a wing of the government is a. party before us  though we are conscious of the fact that in a matter of. condonation of delay when there was no gross negligence or deliberate inaction. or lack of bonafide  a liberal concession has to be adopted to advance. substantial justice  we are of the view that in the facts and circumstances. the department cannot take advantage of various earlier decisions  the claim. on account of impersonal machinery and inherited bureaucratic methodology of. making several notes cannot be 19 accepted in view of the modern technologies. being used and available  the law of limitation undoubtedly binds everybody. including the government  13  in our view  it is the right time to inform all. have reasonable and acceptable explanation for the delay and there was. bonafide effort  there is no need to accept the usual explanation that the. file was kept pending for several months years due to considerable degree of. procedural red tape in the process  the government departments are under a. special obligation to ensure that they perform their duties with diligence and. commitment  condonation of delay is an exception and should not be used as an. anticipated benefit for government departments  the law shelters everyone. under the same light and should not be swirled for the benefit of a few. considering the fact that there was no proper explanation offered by the. department for the delay except mentioning of various dates  according to us. the department has miserably failed to give any acceptable and cogent reasons. sufficient to condone such a huge delay  20 accordingly  the appeals are. liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay  14  in view of our conclusion. on issue  a   there is no need to go into the merits of the issues  b  and. c   the question of law raised is left open to

[Facts] second appeal no  557 of 1945 against the judgment and decree dated the 19th. dadachanji  with him  for the appellant. v  m  tarkunde for the respondents. 1953   february 27  the judgment of the court was delivered by mahajan j  this. confirmed the decree of the lower courts granting possession of land to the. respondents on the forfeiture of a lease  the appeal is confined to survey no. the principal question arising for decision in the ap  peal is whether notice. as contemplated by section iii  g  of the  transfer of property. 1st july  1863  ramabai  while she was in financial difficulties  passed a. permanent lease of both these numbers to one ladha ibrahim sheth  the lessee. paid a premium of rs  999 for the lease  and also agreed to pay 1011 a yearly. rent of rs  80 to ramabai during her lifetime and after her death a yearly. come to an end   on 18th august  1870  ladha ibrahim sold his tenancy rights. to one girdhari balaram lodhi for rs. 7 999  the sale deed provided that in default of payment of rent to ramabai or. her heirs  the purchaser would have no rights whatsoever left over the. property  on the same day the purchaser passed a rent note in favour of. ramabai  the rent note provided for the payment of the agreed rent in the. month of pousb every year  and stated that in case of default the tenant or. defendants are the grandsons of seth girdhari balaram. in spite of the nullity clause in the lease it appears that the lessee has. been more or less a habitual defaulter in the payment of rent  in the year. 1913  rent for six years was in arrears  vinayakbhat filed suit no  99 of 1913. in the court of the ii class sub judge  poona  against the present defendants. for possession of the demised premises on the ground of forfeiture  a number. of defences were raised by them  inter alia  it was pleaded that as no notice. had been given to them the forfeiture was not enforceable  these contentions. were negatived but the court granted relief against forfeiture  defendant no. 1 was a minor at that time and became a major in or about 1925. in the year 1928 again rent for two years was in arrears. vinayakbhat filed civil suit no  258 of 1928 against the present defendants. for possession on the ground of forfeiture  the plaintiff subsequently waived. the forfeiture by accepting three years  rent which by then had fallen in. arrears and costs of the suit. in the year 1931 rent for three years again fell into arrears  the amount was. then sent by money order and the landlord accepted it. in the year 1934 again rent for three years remained unpaid. at that time proceedings were started by government for the acquisition of the. old survey no  72. 1012 the landlord claimed that he was entitled to the whole compensation money. forfeiture was again waived  as a result of this the defendants got rs  32 000. while vinayakbhat got rs  1 400 for compensation for the acquisition of his. in 1938 rent for four years was again in arrears. vinayakbhat filed civil suit no  982 of 1938 in the court of the i class sub. judge at poona against all the present defendants for possession of survey. nos  86 1 and 86 2 on the ground that the lease had determined by forfeiture. defendants to go to the plaintiff and pay it  these contentions were. negatived  it was held that forfeiture had occurred but relief against. forfeiture was again granted. note it was for the plaintiff to approach the defendants and  not for the. defendants to go to the plaintiff and pay it     that as the plaintiff did not. approach the defendants and no demand for rent was made  no forfeiture. occurred  that defendant no  i did offer the rent to the plaintiff  but the. plaintiff fraudulently refused to accept it  that the plaintiff ought to have. sent a notice according to law if he wanted to enforce the right of forfeiture. and that without prejudice to the above contentions he should be granted. end of march  1950  on the question whether a notice was necessary before the. lease could be terminated  the trial court expressed the view that the. provision in the rent note that on non payment of rent the rights of the. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act topa1882258   and that no. notice as required by section 111  g  was necessary for terminating the lease. in suit  on the issue whether forfeiture should be relieved against  the trial. court said that relief could have been given to the lessee against forfeiture. under section 1 14 had it not been for the fact that the defendants had. disentitled themselves to relief by contumacious conduct on their part  that. even this paltry rent had never been paid in time during the last twenty years. three months  on the issue whether a notice was necessary  the appellate court. court of judicature at bombay  the plaintiff filed cross objections in regard. cross objections  an application was made for leave to appeal to the supreme. court and it was granted with reference to survey  no  86 2. the law with regard to the determination of a lease by forfeiture is contained. is section iii  g  of the  transfer of property. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act topa1882258    under that. section was that the lessor was to show his intention to determine the lease. by some act indicating that intention  the principles of justice  equity and. the lower courts had exercised their discretion against the appellant and that. being so  unless they were satisfied that the discretion was not judicially. three years and at other times for four years and so on  and every time the. landlord had to file a suit in ejectment which was always resisted on false. occasion  particularly when he was warned by the court of appeal on a previous. occasion  he had already had relief three times on equitable grounds and it is. time that the court withheld its hands and ordered his ejectment  in this.

vinayakbhat  his adoptive mother was ramabai  she owned two inam. lands at mundhava which were then numbered pratibhandi nos  71 and 72  present. survey nos  86 1 and 86 2 together correspond to old

possession on the ground of forfeiture and for the arrears of rent which. remained unpaid  it was alleged in the plaint that the rent due on 28th. january  1941  was not paid  though demanded. the structures thereon  defendant no  1 pleaded that as a result of partition. rights in survey no. 86 2 had fallen to 1013 his share  that according to the terms of the rent. 111  g  of the transfer of pro perty act  but that no notice of forfeiture was. necessary as the lease had been executed prior to the coming into force of the. from this appellate decree defendant no  i filed a second appeal to the high. provision a lease is determined by forfeiture in case the lessee breaks an. express condition which provides that on breach thereof the lessor may re. enter  or in case the lessee renounces his character as such by setting up a. title in a third person or by claiming title in himself  or the lessee is. adjudicated an insolvent and the lease provides that the lessor may reenter on. other words  without this act there is no completed forfeiture at all  under. the old section an overt act evidencing the requisite intention was essential. as the law stands today under the act  notice in writing by the landlord is a. condition precedent to a forfeiture and the right of re entry  section 63 of. act xx of 1929  restricts the operation of this amendment to transfers of. property made after 1st april  1930  the lease in this case was executed. before the  transfer of property. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act topa1882258   came into. force in 1882  the amendment therefore made in this sub section by act xx of. 1929 not being retrospective  cannot touch the present lease and it is also. excluded from the reach of the  transfer of property. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act topa1882258   by the. provisions of section 2  the position was not seriously disputed in the high. court or before us that the statutory provisions of section 111 g  as such. cannot be made to govern the present lease which was executed in the year. conscience and notwithstanding section 2 of the act  that principle was. applicable in this case and there can be no forfeiture unless notice in. writing to the lessee of his intention to determine the lease by the lessor. bad been given. it is axiomatic that the courts must apply the principles of justice  equity. and good conscience to transactions which come up before them for. determination even though the statutory provisions of the transfer of 1016. property act are not made applicable to these transactions. it follows therefore that the provisions of the act which are but a statutory. recognition of the rules of justice  equity  and good conscience also govern. those transfers. if  therefore  we are satisfied that the particular principle to which the. legislature has now given effect by the amendment to section 111  g  did in. force. the main point for consideration   thus is whether the particular provision. instance it may be observed that it is erroneous to suppose that every. provision in the  transfer of property. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act topa1882258   and every. written one without in any way disturbing the mind of a chancery judge  the. requirement as to written notice provided in the section therefore cannot be. said to be based on any general rule of equity  that it is not so is apparent. from the circumstance that the requirement of a notice in writing to complete. a forfeiture has been dispensed with by the legislature in respect to leases. executed before 1st april  1930  those leases are still governed by the. unamended sub section  g  of section 1 1 1  all that was required by that sub. one contained in sub section  g  as it stood before 1929  and to leases. the english law on the subject is stated in foa s general law of landlord and. by saying that the lease is voidable and not void. but the true principle appears to be that the lease does become void to all. intents and purposes  though this is subject to the condition that the party. who is seeking to set up its invalidity 132 1018 is not himself in default. for otherwise he would be taking advantage of his own wrong  it follows that. where the proviso makes the lease void  the landlord must  in order to take. advantage of it  do some unequivocal act notified to the lessee  indicating. his intention to avail himself of the option given to him  the service upon. the lessee in possession of a writ in ejectment is sufficient. the law of property act  1925  by section 146 has consolidated the law in. england on this subject  the provision with regard to the giving of notice. before a right of re entry accrues to the landlord is expressly excluded by. sub section  11  in cases of re entry on forfeiture for non  payment of rent. in england it is not necessary in case of non payment of rent for a landlord. to give notice before a forfeiture results  it cannot  therefore  be said that. what has been enacted in sub section  g  of section ii 1 is a matter which. even today in english law is considered as a matter of justice  equity and. good conscience  in english law the bringing of an action which corresponds to. the institution of a suit in india is itself an act which is definitely. regarded as evidencing an intention on the part of the lessor to determine a. lease with regard to which there has been a breach of covenant entitling the. when the suit is instituted  i e   the moment the plaint is presented  the. cause of action for the suit can arise simultaneously with the presentation of. a plaint. in our opinion the provision as to notice in writing as a preliminary to a. suit for ejectment based on forfeiture of a lease is not based on any. high court was therefore right in the view that it took of the matter and. there are no valid reasons for taking a contrary view. considerable reliance was placed by mr  daphtary on the decision of. according to it the institution of a suit for ejectment would be sufficient. prerequisite for institution of such a suit  in our judg  ment  this case was. wrongly decided and we are unable to support it. as pointed out by napier j  in krishna shetti v  gilbert pinto  1   the courts. should be very careful in applying statutory provisions and the assistance of. on matters which have been excluded from the purview of the act by express. words should not be invoked  unless the provisions of the act embody. principles of general application. the lessee for the possession and profits of land on the one side and. recompense by rent or other consideration on the other  the statute has given. a more comprehensive definition of the term  section 107 makes registration of. a lease compulsory. this section again does not concern itself with any princi  ple of justice or. equity  section 108  j  enacts that the lessee may transfer absolutely by way. of mortgage or sublease the whole or any part of his interest in the property. and any transferee of such interest or part may again transfer it  the law in. india and england on this subject is not the same and it cannot be said that. not followed his own earlier decision in arriving at his conclusions here. with respect we think that that decision did not state the law on the point. correctly  under english law the institution of a suit for ejectment has. always been considered an unequivocal act on the part of the landlord for. taking advantage of the default of the tenant and for enforcing the forfeiture. necessary for the licensor to have done some act showing his intention to. determine the licence and until such act was shown  it continued in force. dig  and did not pass the land  an actual entry  therefore  was unnecessary to. avoid it  but by analogy to what is required to be done in order to determine. a freehold lease which  by the terms of it  is to be void on the non. performance of covenants  it seems to follow that  to put an end to this. licence  the grantor should have given notice of his intention so to do   the. basis of the decision was that some act amounting to an exercise of the option. had to be proved before the licence was determined. this decision therefore does not in any way affect the decision of the high. court in this case. on the question whether the tenant should have been given relief against. forfeiture the high court held that the matter was one of discretion and both. will be refused  but if that position is not altered so that no injustice will. be done there is no real discretion and the court should make the order and. the sun  required under the section was paid or tendered to the lessor at the. hearing of the suit the court has no discretion  in the matter and must grant. relief to the tenant  we do not think that the learned judges intended to lay. down any hard and fast rule  indeed the learned judge proceeded to observe as. follows    in exercising the discretion with which it is invested under. section 114 a court in india is not bound by the practice of a court of. chancery in england  and i am not disposed to limit the discretion that it. possesses  those who seek equity must do equity  and i do not think merely. discretion  each case must be judged by itself  the delay  the conduct of the. parties and the difficulties to which the landlord  has been put should be. weighed against the tenant  this was the view taken by the madras high court. equity  then the court s hands are not tied to exercise it in his favour. dealing belongs to some one else  by taking advantage of a breach from which. he is not commensurately and irreparably damaged  it is not advisable to lay. down any rigid rules for guiding that discretion  i do not doubt that the. rules enunciated by the master of the rolls in the present case are useful. disregarded  if it were otherwise the free discretion given by the statute. would be fettered by limitations which have nowhere been enacted  it is one. thing to decide what is the true meaning of the language contained in an act. of parliament  it is quite a different thing to place conditions upon a free. discretion entrusted by statute to the court where the conditions are not. based upon statutory enactment at all  it is not safe  i think  to say that. the court must and will always insist upon certain things when the act does. not require them  and the facts of some unforeseen case may make the court. wish it had kept a free hand   with great respect we think that the. observations cited above contain sound principles of law  we are  therefore. unable to accede to the contention of mr  daphtary that though section 114 of. the  transfer of property. act  http   www liiofindia org in legis cen num act topa1882258   confers a. discretion on the court  that discretion except in cases where third party. interests intervene must always be exercised in favour of the tenant. irrespective of the conduct of the tenant  it is clear that in this case the. tenant is a recalcitrant tenant and is a habitual defaulter. for the best part of 25 years he has never paid rent without being sued in. advantage of his own wrong and to plead relief against forfeiture on every. it would not interfere with the 1028 discretion of the courts below in.
