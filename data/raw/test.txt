[Facts] the appellant is a company incorporated under the companies act 1956 with the object of manufacture and sale of cigarettes. members of general public are the shareholders and the shares of the company are traded in through various stock exchanges in the country. a petition was filed under article 226 of the constitution by respondent no 1 seeking for a writ of mandamus to treat the members of the respondent union who are employees working in the canteen of the appellants factory as employees of the appellant and for grant of monetary and other consequential benefits. the learned single judge who decided the matter in the first instance held that a writ would lie against a company under a private management following the decision in t gattaiah vs. commissioner of labour 1981  ii   llj 54 1981 indlaw ap 26 in which it was held that establishment of a canteen and its maintenance is a statutory requirement  under section 46 of the act a public duty is imposed on the company to establish and maintain the canteen  inasmuch as members of the respondent union are working in the canteen they are entitled to seek a mandamus. he therefore held that when a public duty is called upon to be discharged by a private management a writ of mandamus would lie and could be issued under article 226 of the constitution. he thus rejected the contention. on that basis the learned single judge granted reliefs sought for by the respondents however imposing certain restrictions with regard to the age being medically fit on the date of the writ petition had put in a minimum of three years of continuous service and such service prior to the attainment of the minimum qualifying age under the company should be ignored. on appeal the division bench of the high court affirmed the view taken by the learned single judge. the division bench referred to their decision in rakesh gupta vs. hyderabad stock exchange ltd. hyderabad   ors  air 1996 ap 430 1996 indlaw ap. 302 that a writ in the nature of mandamus certiorari and prohibition are recognised as public law remedies and are not available to enforce private law rights. however noticing that the expression any person or authority used in article 226 of the constitution should not be confined only to statutory authorities and instrumentalities of state but would cover any other person or body performing public duty. the duty must be judged in the light of positive obligation owed by the person or authority to the affected party no matter by what means the duty is imposed. on that basis the division bench of the high court dismissed the writ appeal. hence this appeal. the canteen has been there since the inception of the appellants factory. the workmen have been employed for long years and despite a change of contractors the workers have continued to be employed in the canteen. the premises furniture fixture fuel electricity utensils etc have been provided for by the appellant. the wages of the canteen workers have to be reimbursed by the appellant. the supervision and control on the canteen is exercised by the appellant through its authorised officer as can be seen from the various clauses of the contract between the appellant and the contractor. the contractor is nothing but an agent or a manager of the appellant who works completely under the supervision control and directions of the appellant. the workmen have the protection of continuous employment in the establishment. the tribunal held against them as there was no material to show that the management had discussed on each point and thereafter an agreement had been drafted. the tribunal recorded the findings that the canteen had been working for the benefit of the workmen within the premises provided by and with the equipment supplied by the appellant  that the appellant supplies the provisions for the preparation of foodstuffs  that the appellant issues token to the employees who on production of the same obtain foodstuffs from the canteen  that the committee appointed by the appellant decides the menu and as per the directions and supervision of the catering officer the canteen functions  that the quality and quantity of the foodstuffs is supervised by him who functions under the committee. the contributions like esi provident fund etc had also been categorically specified to be provided by the appellant and esi code for the permanent establishment and for the present workmen was the same  that after the evidence was tendered by the workmen the appellant got the code changed and the appellant transferred the workmen from one place to another and that the amount to be surrendered by way of unpaid salaries had to be remitted back to the management. thus the tribunal held that these facts clearly indicated that the appellant exercised administrative financial and disciplinary control over the workmen in question. the tribunal held that no other material is required to hold them to be employees of the appellant. in those circumstances the tribunal passed an award that these workmen should be treated as employees of the appellant and they are entitled to payment of appropriate scales and designations in terms of ex w12 and w14 from 1 april 1979 with all consequential and attendant benefits of arrears of pay etc together with counting of entire service for the purpose of terminal benefits. against this award a writ petition was filed before the high court. the high court dismissed the same stating that it is covered by another matter. it is unnecessary to examine the contention whether the matter is covered by a subsequent decision or not as the facts of the present case stand on its own. the reference had been made to the tribunal and adjudication had been made by the tribunal as to the status of the workmen the nature of employment control exercised by the appellant which leave no room for doubt that they are the employees of the appellant.
[Ratio of the decision] in de smith woolf and jowells judicial review of administrative action 5th edn  it is noticed that not all the activities of the private bodies are subject to private law e g  the activities by private bodies may be governed by the standards of public law when its decisions are subject to duties conferred by statute or when by virtue of the function it is performing or possibly its dominant position in the market it is under an implied duty to act in the public interest. by way of illustration it is noticed that a private company selected to run a prison although motivated by commercial profit should be regarded at least in relation to some of its activities as subject to public law because of the nature of the function it is performing. this is because the prisoners for whose custody and care it is responsible are in the prison in consequence of an order of the court and the purpose and nature of their detention is a matter of public concern and interest. after detailed discussion the learned authors have summarized the position with the following propositions   1  the test of whether a body is performing a public function and is hence amenable to judicial review may not depend upon the source of its power or whether the body is ostensibly a public or a private body. 2  the principles of judicial review prima facie govern the activities of bodies performing public functions. however not all decisions taken by bodies in the course of their public functions are the subject matter of judicial review. in the following two situations judicial review will not normally be appropriate even though the body may be performing a public function   a  where some other branch of the law more appropriately governs the dispute between the parties. in such a case that branch of the law and its remedies should and normally will be applied  and  b  where there is a contract between the litigants. in such a case the express or implied terms of the agreement should normally govern the matter. this reflects the normal approach of english law namely that the terms of a contract will normally govern the transaction or other relationship between the parties rather than the general law. thus where a special method of resolving disputes  such as arbitration or resolution by private or domestic tribunals  has been agreed by the parties  expressly or by necessary implication  that regime and not judicial review will normally govern the dispute. the high court has relied very strongly on the decision of a learned single judge in t gattaiahs case wherein it was stated that a writ may lie under article 226 of the constitution against a company incorporated under the companies act 1956 as it is permissible to issue a writ against any person. prima facie therefore a private person or an incorporated company cannot be taken out of the sweep and the contemplation of article 226 of the constitution. that decision does not take note of the fact as to the nature of the functions that a person or an incorporated company should be performing to attract judicial review under article 226 of the constitution. in anadi muktas case this court examined the various aspects and the distinction between an authority and a person and after analysis of the decisions referred in that regard came to the conclusion that it is only in the circumstances when the authority or the person performs a public function or discharges a public duty article 226 of the constitution can be invoked. in the present case the appellant is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes. manufacture and sale of cigarettes will not involve any public function. incidental to that activity there is an obligation under section 46 of the act to set up a canteen when the establishment has more than 250 workmen. that means it is a condition of service in relation to a workman providing better facilities to workmen to discharge their duties properly and maintain their own health or welfare. in other words it is only a labour welfare device for the benefit of its work force unlike a provision where pollution control act makes it obligatory even on a private company not to discharge certain effluents. in such cases public duty is owed to the public in general and not specific to any person or group of persons. further the damage that would be caused in not observing them is immense. if merely what can be considered a part of the conditions of service of a workman is violated then we do not think there is any justification to hold that such activity will amount to public duty. thus we are of the view that the high court fell into error that appellant is amenable to writ jurisdiction. this court in indian petrochemicals corporation ltd   anr vs. shramik sena   ors  1999 6  scc. 439 1999 indlaw sc 513 referred to the decisions in parimal chandra rahas case reserve bank of india vs. workmen 1996. 3  scc 267 and m m r khan vs. union of india 1990 supp. scc 191 1996 indlaw sc 618 and held that the workmen of a statutory canteen as in the present case would be workmen of an establishment for the purposes of the act only and not for other purposes. thereafter this court further examined whether the material on record would show that the workmen are employees of the management for all purposes and adopted some of the tests as follows. in the present case the findings recorded by the learned single judge on examination of the facts available is that there had been a canteen within the premises of the appellant up to the year 1982 and it is only from 1982 onwards the management of the canteen has been entrusted to a private contractor  that even after change of the contractor the canteen workers have continued to be the same irrespective of the change in the contractors from time to time  that wages were paid to the workmen in the canteen by the management through the contractor  that the appellant has provided the accommodation furniture fuel electricity utensils etc. that the management exercises control over the standard in quality quantity and the rate of the food items supplied to the workmen for whose benefit the canteen is established. thus these circumstances clearly indicate that the appellant has a complete control over the activities in respect of the canteen and the contractor has absolutely no discretion either in regard to the menu quality and quantity of the food items much less the rate at which the same are supplied to the workmen. when the management of the appellant exercises such a complete control the canteen shall be deemed to be run by the management itself. the appellant in any manner cannot controvert these facts. we do agree that the respondents have a strong case on merits. since we have held that the high court had no jurisdiction to entertain a petition under article 226 of the constitution we would have set aside the order made by the high court. however in the special features of the case although we do not agree with the high court on the first question raised we feel after clarifying the legal position that we should not disturb the decision given by the high court. in these appeals on a reference made on the question whether certain persons employed in the canteen should be treated as employees of the appellant and if so in what category they are to be fitted in and to what wages they are entitled to the industrial tribunal hyderabad  hereinafter referred to as the tribunal  inquired into the matter. however there is no material on record to show that the canteen is located in such an area where it would be hazardous to have a fire furnace source of heat or light to cook food. in the absence of such material we find no substance in this contention. it is brought to our notice that a fire had taken place on a tank on 14 september 1997 and that it was extinguished after 14 days which severely damaged all the building including the canteen and that food and beverages being provided to its employees by making an arrangement to obtain the same from outside the premises of the appellant. these facts are brought to our notice by an affidavit filed on 21 november 2000 but these factors do not come in the way of the award made by the tribunal as it is possible to locate the canteen in an appropriate place where there is no hazard of the kind envisaged under the petroleum rules. this contention is also rejected.

[Facts] in these appeals the dispute relates to payment of compensation pursuant to acquisition of land of respondent m s. jaswant sugar mills ltd  hereinafter referred to as the  company   and auction of part of the land of the company. there being cross claims all of these appeals were heard together for determination by a common judgment. the company preferred two writ petitions challenging the orders passed by the district magistrate collector meerut and board of revenue dated 18th december 1995 and 3rd august 1996 respectively. the aforesaid orders were also challenged by the state government. the writ petitions were disposed of by the learned single judge of allahabad high court by a common judgment dated 1st. march 2011 by the said judgment the high court directed the state government to pay the company the compensation on the basis of the compromise reached between the state government and the tenure holder company for acquisition of their land by meerut development authority. it is also directed that out of compensation paid by the meerut development authority  about rs 4 33 crores  an amount of rs 1 62 crores shall be deducted and the remaining amount shall be paid to the company. the state has been given liberty to realize the said amount from those authorities to whom it was wrongly paid by the previous collector tulsi gaur under his order dated 20th. february 1992 the impugned judgment dated 1st march 2011 has been challenged by the state of u p in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013  state of u p   ors. vs. m s. jaswant sugar mills ltd. ors etc   as also by m s. jaswant sugar mills ltd in c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013. ors  m s. jaswant sugar mills ltd vs. the colletor district magistrate   ors. a piece of land of the company was put to auction for recovery of dues of the company. it was challenged by the company by filing a writ petition. the high court by impugned judgment dated 27th april 2001 cancelled the auction sale and allowed the writ petition. in a review application preferred by auction purchaser the high court by order dated 3rd september 2001 directed the respondents to refund the amount to the auction purchasers. the aforesaid judgment and orders are under challenge in c a nos 7122 of 2003 7123 7124 of 2003 7125 of 2003 and 7126 7129 of 2003. c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 and c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013. for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 and c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013 it is desirable to refer the relevant factual matrix of the case which is as follows. the proprietors of respondent company namely m s. jaswant sugar mills ltd had six business units as under  m s. meerut straw board mills. pootha farm. northern india paper mills. bindal vanaspati ghee mills. meduwala open pan sugar bijnor. the company was in heavy arrears as on 3rd january 1977 to the extent of rs 1 14 crores. accordingly the district collector meerut appointed a receiver under section 286 a of u p zamindari abolition and land reforms act  hereinafter referred to as the  zamindari abolition act. subsequently the company was acquired by the state on 28th october 1984. as per provisions of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act 1971  hereinafter referred to as the  acquisition act 1971   as amended in the year 1984 free from all encumbrances and the said unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation  hereinafter referred to as the  corporation. since the company was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores the district collector meerut by order dated 28th november 1984 attached all the remaining five constituent units except the sugar mill. the general manger of the aforesaid sugar unit was appointed as a receiver with reference to all the aforesaid remaining five units. in between 1977 to 1984 for smooth functioning of the sugar mill payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc  on the request of the receiver the state government granted loan of rs 6 13 crores to the company and was to be recovered as the arrears of land revenue along with interest. the district collector meerut taking into consideration the dues to the extent of rs 1 62 crores as on 24th october 1990 were to be paid by the company extended the tenure of the receiver till further orders. the order of the extension of tenure of the receiver was challenged by the ex proprietors of the company in a writ petition no 18496 1991 subsequently the receiver was withdrawn on 18th december 1995 therefore the writ petition was also withdrawn. pursuant to  uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling of land holdings act   hereinafter referred to as the  ceiling act   land admeasuring 723 3 bigha belonging to the company was declared surplus. against the same a writ petition no 3905 1987 was preferred by the company. during the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition the state government issued a notification dated 14th august 1987 u s 4 read with s 17 4  of the land acquisition act 1894 for the meerut development authority. it was followed by a notification dated 4th september 1987 issued u s 6 of the acquisition act. the said notification included the land of m s pootha farm a constituent unit of the company. in the said case compensation amount of rs 4 33 crores was awarded by special land acquisition officer vide award dated 22nd february 1990. the district collector meerut pursuant to a report of the tehsildar ordered to pay the compensation amount after adjustment of different dues payable by the company 11 pursuant to a court s order the district collector meerut passed a speaking order dated 20th february 1992 showing the details of adjustments to be made out of compensation amount of rs 4 34 crores payable by the company as detailed below. the district collector in the said order dated 20th february 1992 concluded that after such adjustment the following dues were still to be paid by the company. the state government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under u p sugar undertaking  acquisition  act 1971 however the aforesaid claim was rejected by the prescribed authority by order dated 4th october 1994 in claim no 13 of 1999. against the said order dated 4th october 1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 1 95 before the appellate tribunal. by order dated 12th october 1995 the appellate tribunal directed the appellant to file a fresh deduction claim before the prescribed authority. the company moved an application before the district collector meerut stating therein that as on date there are no arrears liability payable by the company therefore requested to remove the receiver. the district collector meerut by order dated 18th december 1995 allowed the case no 30 1995 with observation that as on the date no recovery certificate was pending against the company. hence the appointment of receiver was terminated with immediate effect. it was further ordered that a detailed list of the assets be prepared and signed by both the parties and the assets be transferred to the company. an order was passed to appoint a chartered accountant to complete the audit of the accounts. as the order dated 18th december 1995 passed by the district collector meerut is silent about the amount payable to the company the ex proprietor of the company moved an application before the chairman board of revenue and requested to refund the compensation amount to the company. the company filed a writ petition no 10220 1996 before high court for modification of the order of the district collector meerut dated 18th december 1995. during the pendency of the said case the chairman board of revenue by order dated 3rd august 1996 directed that out of the total amount of rs 4 33 crores received as compensation from meerut development authority after deduction of a sum of rs 1 62 crores along with interest and collection charges the balance amount shall be refunded to the company. against the aforesaid order dated 3rd august 1996 passed by the chairman board of revenue the company filed writ petition no 31378 1996 on the ground that there is no dues payable by the company. in the said case the u p state sugar corporation ltd filed a counter affidavit refuting such stand taken by the company. a separate counter affidavit was filed by the deputy secretary sugar and cane development lucknow giving details of dues payable by the company as detailed by the district collector meerut by his order dated 18th december 1995. against the interim order the appellant state filed the special appeals. by judgment and order dated 7th july 2010 passed in special appeal nos 5179 80 2010 the high court quashed the interim order dated 17th july 1997 passed by the learned single judge. it was ordered to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously. in the meantime the district collector by its notice dated 22nd august 2005 directed the company to refund certain amount. the said notice was also challenged by the company. the high court by judgment and order dated 23rd february 2011 quashed the notice dated 22nd august 2005. with direction to the appellant to pay the compensation amount to the company. however it was clarified that if the land which have been acquired finally does not fall within the ceiling limit of the company then it will be open for the state to recover it after the finalisation of the ceiling proceedings as per law. subsequently impugned common judgment and order dated 1st. march 2011 was passed in writ petition no 31378 1996 etc  with observation and directions as referred to above. for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 7122 of 2003 7123 7124 of 2003 7125 of 2003 and 7126 7129 of 2003 relevant factual matrix of the case is as follows. after giving credit of rs 4 33 crores payable by the state government on account of amounts towards compensation for acquisition of land the liability of the company was determined at rs 6 09 crores on 20th february 1992 a sale proclamation was accordingly issued. the land of the company measuring 1 391 hectares in village maliyana was put to auction. the appellants m s. ltd and another were the highest bidders. according to auction purchasers the entire amount was paid as per highest bid. title to the land was also transferred in their favour. the company being aggrieved preferred a civil misc. writ petition no 16451 of 1999 before the high court of judicature at allahabad challenging the sale proclamation dated 28th march 1992 order dated 30th may 1992 passed by sub divisional magistrate meerut confirming the sale of the properties owned by the company and the order dated 5th april 1999 passed by the commissioner meerut division meerut whereby the objections filed by the company under rule 285 1 of the rules framed under u p zamindari abolition and land reforms act  hereinafter referred to as the  land reforms act   was rejected. ltd being aggrieved by the said judgment preferred review application under order xlvii rule 1 cpc for review of the judgment and order dated 27th april 2001 passed by the high court. another application was filed by m s. ltd under order xivii rule 1 cpc for review of the order dated 3rd september 2001 the said review application was dismissed by the impugned judgment dated 15th march 2002. as against the said order c a nos 7126 29 2003. commissioner meerut division meerut   ors. jaswant sugar mills ltd   have been preferred by the commissioner meerut division meerut. the said case was also tagged with the aforesaid appeals.
[Ratio of the decision] we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january 1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver. subsequently sugar mill of the company was acquired on 28th october 1984. under sugar undertakings acquisition act 1971 and the unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation. till 28th november 1984 the company was the owner of the units sugar mill. it was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores. therefore the district collector meerut attached remaining five constituent units and the general manager of the sugar unit was appointed as a receiver. in between 1979 and 1984 the state government extended a facility of loan to the extent of rs 6 13 crores to the receiver appointed by the state government for smooth functioning of the sugar mill including payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc. it is also not in dispute that labour and other dues were payable by the company apart from sale tax dues and the loan was given by the state government between 1977 1984 for payment of such dues. the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march 2011 though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february 1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue. the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act 1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act 1971. any liability incurred by the company or loan etc taken by the receiver is not payable by the company. it is always open to the competent authority to seek recovery of the amount if due from the company or to adjust the dues. the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name. the order dated 20th february 1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february 1992 as illegal. the aforesaid orders have been challenged in c a no 7122 of 2003  m s. rudra estate pvt ltd   anr vs. jaswant sugar mills ltd   ors   c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 c a no 7125 of 2003  shri munindra singh   anr vs. jaswant sugar mills ltd   ors. and c a nos 7126 7129 of 2003  commissioner meerut division meerut vs. m s jaswant sugar mills ltd. we have heard the parties only on the limited question as to why the amount which has been directed to be refunded to the auction purchasers appellants herein should not bear reasonable interest. in a situation like in the present case one cannot hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law. counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale. the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground. in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers  they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated. it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour. but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled. it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser. appellant s  we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount. taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6  on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april 2001 and 3rd. september 2001 the day the high court passed the impugned order. the concerned respondents are directed accordingly.

[Facts] the price which the manufacturer of barlagan kotone  reported to the central government in 1971 was rs 24 735 68 per kg. after the 1979 drugs  prices control. order came into force  the distinction between essential and non essential bulk drugs was abolished and a maximum price had to be fixed for barlagan ketone also like other bulk drugs. the manufacturer applied for fixation of price at rs 8 500 per kg. armed with authority under the drugs  prices control. order  1979 the central government issued notifications fixing the maximum prices at which various indigenously manufactured bulk drugs may be sold by the manufacturers. these notifications were questioned on several grounds by the manufacturers and they have been quashed by the delhi high court on the ground of failure to observe the principles of natural justice. since prices of  formulations  are primarily dependent on prices of  buli drugs   the notifications fixing the retail prices of formulations were also quashed. the manufacturers had also filed review petitions before the government under paragraph 27 of the 1979 order. the review petitions could not survive after the notifications sought to be reviewed had themselves been quashed. nevertheless the high court gave detailed directions regarding the manner of disposal of the review petitions by the high court. the union of india has preferred these appeals by special leave of this court against the judgment of the high court. the case for the union of india was presented to us ably by shri g  ramaswami  the learned additional solicitor general and the manufacturers were represented equally ably by shri anil diwan.
[Ratio of the decision] it was just the other day that our brothers ranganath misra and m m  dutt  jj  had to give directions in a case  vincent panikurbangara v  union of india  where a public spirited litigant had complained about the unscrupulous exploitation of the indian drug and pharmaceutical market by multinational corporations by putting in circulation low quality and even deleterious drugs. in this group of cases we are faced with a different problem of alleged exploitation by big manufacturers of bulk drugs. the problem is that of high prices  bearing  it is said  little relation to the cost of production to the manufacturers. by way of illustration  we may straightaway mention a glaring instance of such high pricing which was brought to our notice at the very commencement of the hearing. barlagan ketone   a bulk drug  was not treated as an essential bulk drug under the drugs  prices control. order  1970 and was not included in the schedule to that order. a manufacturer was  under the provisions of that order  free to continue to sell the drug at the price reported by him to the central government at the time of the commencement of the order  but was under an obligation not to increase the price without the prior approval of the central government. the government  however  fixed the price at rs 1 810 per kg. for the moment  ignoring the price fixed by the government  we see that the price of rs 24 735 per kg. at which the manufacturer was previously selling the drug and at which he continues to market the drug to this day because of the quashing of the order fixing the price by the high court  is so unconsciously high even compared with the price claimed by himself that it appears to justify the charge that some manufacturers do indulge in  profiteering. profiteering  by itself  is evil. profiteering in the scarce resources of the community  much needed life sustaining food stuffs and lifesaving drugs is diabolic. it is a menance which had to be lettered and curbed. one of the principal objectives of the essential commodities act  1955 is precisely that. before we turn to the terms of the drugs  prices control. order  1979 we would like to make certain general observations and explain the legal position in regard to them. we start with the observation   price fixation is neither the function nor the forte of the court. we concern ourselves neither with the policy nor with the rates. but we do not totally deny ourselves the jurisdiction to enquire into the question  in appropriate proceedings  whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant considerations kept out of the determination of the price. for example  if the legislature has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determination of the price  we will  if necessary  enquire into the question whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price. but our examination will stop there. we will go no further. we will not deluge ourselves with more facts and figures. the assembling of the raw materials and the mechanics of price fixation are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them. and  we will not revaluate the considerations even if the prices are demonstrably injurious to some manufacturers or producers. the court will  of course  examine if there is any hostile discrimination. that is a different  cup of tea  altogether. the second observation we wish to make is  legislative action  plenary or subordinate  is not subject to rules of natural justice. in the case of parliamentary legislation  the proposition is self evident. in the case of subordinate  legislation  it may happen that parliament may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing there are several instances of the legislature requiring the subordinate legislating authority to give public notice and a public hearing before say  for example  levying a municipal rate   in which case the substantial non observance of the statutorily prescribed mode of observing natural justice may have the effect of invalidating the subordinate legislation. the right here given to rate payers or others is in the nature of a concession which is not to detract from the character of the activity as legislative and not quasijudicial. but  where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing  no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity. occasionally  the legislature directs the subordinate legislating body to make  such enquiry as it thinks fit  before making the subordinate legislation. in such a situation  while such enquiry by the subordinate legislating body as it deems fit is a condition precedent to the subordinate legislation  the nature and the extent of the enquiry is in the discretion of the subordinate legislating body and the subordinate legislation is not open to question on the ground that the enquiry was not as full as it might have been. the provision for  such enquiry as it thinks fit  is generally an enabling provision  intended to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from all and whatever source and not intended to vest any right in any one other than the subordinate legislating body. it is the sort of enquiry which the legislature itself may cause to be made before legislating  an enquiry which will not confer any right on anyone. the third observation we wish to make is  price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative activity than any other. it is true that  with the proliferation of delegated legislation  there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion. administrative  quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and  conversely  legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activity. any attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions  it has been said  is  difficult in theory and impossible in practice. though difficult  it is necessary that the line must sometimes be drawn as different legal fights and consequences may ensue. the distinction between the two has usually been expressed as  one between the general and the particular. a legislative act is the creation and promulgation of a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases  an administrative act is the making and issue of a specific direction or the application of a general rule to a particular case in accordance with the requirements of policy. legislation is the process of formulating a general rule of conduct without reference to particular cases and usually operating in future  administration is the process of performing particular acts  of issuing particular orders or of making decisions which apply general rules to particular cases. it has also been said  rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class  while   an adjudication  on the other hand  applies to specific individuals or situations. but  this is only a bread distinction  not necessarily always true. administration and administrative adjudication may also be of general application and there may be legislation of particular application only. that is not ruled out. again  adjudication determines past and present facts and declares rights and liabilities while legislation indicates the future course of action. adjudication is determinative of the past and the present while legislation is indicative of the future. the object of the rule  the reach of its application  the rights and obligations arising out of it  its intended effect on past  present and future events  its form  the manner of its promulgation are some factors which may help in drawing the line between legislative and non legislative acts. a price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer. it is generally in relation to a particular commodity or class of commodities or transactions. it is a direction of a general character  not directed against a particular situation. it is intended to operate in the future. it is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public. the right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the state to so provide them are transformed into the power of the state to fix prices and the obligation of the producer to charge n6 more than the price fixed. viewed from whatever angle  the angle of general application the prospectivity of its effect  the public interest served  and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom  there can be no question that price fixation is ordinarily a legislative activity. pricefixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals. such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the government or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined according to the statutory guidelines laid down by it. in such situations the determination of price may acquire aquasi judicial character. otherwise  price fixation is generally a legislative activity. we also wish to clear a misapprehension which appears to prevail in certain circles that price fixation affects the manufacturer or producer primarily and therefore fairness requires that he be given an opportunity and that fair opportunity to the manufacturer or producer must be read into the procedure for price fixation. we do not agree with the basic premise that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers. those who are most vitally affected are the consumer public. it is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer  if not more. the three observations made by us are well settled and wellfounded on authority. the cases to which we shall now refer  will perhaps elucidate what we have tried  unfelicitously  to express. we mentioned that the panipat and the anakapalle eases were distinguished in shree meenakshi  and prag ice. panipat and anakapalle were both cases where the question was regarding the price payable to a person who was required to sell to the government a certain percentage of the quantity of sugar produced in his mill. the order requiring him to sell the sugar to the government was made under s  3 2  f  of the essential commodities act under which the central government was enabled to make an order requiring any person engaged in the production of any essential commodity to sell the whole or specified part of the quantity produced by him to the government or its nominee. it will straight away be seen that an order under s  3 2  f  if a specific order directed to a particular individual for the purpose of enabling the central government to purchase a certain quantity of the commodity from the person holding it. it is an order for a compulsory sale. when such a compulsory sale is required to be made under s  3 2  f   the question naturally arises what is the price to be paid for the commodity purchased. it is further prescribed that different prices may be determined  from time to time  for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar. it is to be noticed here that the payment to be made under s  3 3c  is not necessarily the same as the controlled price which may be fixed under s  3 2  c  of the act. while s  3 2  c  contemplates an order of a general nature  s  3 3c  contemplates a specific transaction. if the provisions of s  3 2  c  under which the price of an essential commodity may be controlled are contrasted with s  3 3c  under which payment is to be made for a commodity require to be sold by an individual to the government  the distinction between a legislative act and a non legislative act will at once become clear. the order made under s  3 2c   which is not in respect of a single transaction  nor directed to particular individual is clearly a legislative act  while an order made under s  3 3c  which is in respect of a particular transaction of compulsory sale from a specific individual is a non legislative act. the order made under s  3 2  c  controlling the price of an essential commodity may itself prescribe the manner in which price is to be fixed but that will not make the fixation of price a non legislative activity  when the activity is not directed towards a single individual or transaction but is of a general nature  covering all individuals and all transactions. the legislative character of the activity is not shed and an administrative or quasi judicial character acquired merely because guidelines prescribed by the statutory order have to be taken into account. we may refer at this juncture to some illuminating passages from schwrtz s book on  administrative law. he said   if a particular function is termed  legislative  or  rulemaking  rather than  judicial  or  adjudication   it may have substantial effects upon the parties concerned. if the function is treated as legislative in nature  there is no right to notice and hearing  unless a statute expressly requires them. if a hearing is held in accordance with a statutory requirement  it normally need not be a formal one  governed by the requirements discussed in chapters 6 and 7. the characterization of an administrative act as legislative instead of judicial is thus of great significance. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x. as a federal court has recently pointed out  there is no  bright line  between rule making and adjudication. the most famous pre apa attempt to explain the difference between legislative and judicial functions was made by justice holmes in prentis v  atlantic coast line co. a judicial inquiry   said he   investigates  declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist. that is its purpose and end. legislation on the other hand looks to the future and changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power. the key factor in the holmes analysis is time  a rule prescribes future patterns of conduct  a decision determines liabilities upon the basis of present or past facts. the element of applicability has been emphasized by others as the key in differentiating legislative from judicial functions. according to chief justice burger   rulemaking is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class. an adjudication  on the other hand  applies to specific individuals or situations. rulemaking affects the rights of individuals in the abstract and must be applied in a further proceeding before the legal position of any particular individual will be definitely affected  adjudication operates conceretly upon individuals in their individual x x capacity. we may now turn our attention to the two drugs  prices control  order of 1970 and 1979  both of which were made by the central government in exercise of its powers under s  3 of the essential commodities act. bulk drugs were divided into essential bulk drugs which were included in the schedule and bulk drugs which were not so included. in the case of essential bulk drugs  paragraph 4 of the order enabled the central government to fix the maximum price at which such essential bulk drugs should be sold. in the case of bulk drugs  which were not included in the schedule  a manufacturer was entitled to continue to market the product at the same price at which he was marketing the products at the time of the commencement of the order. he was required to report this price to the central government within two weeks of the commencement of the order and was further prohibited from increasing the price without obtaining the approval of the central government. a committee on drugs and pharmaceutical industry  popularly known as the hathi committee was appointed by the government of india to enquire into the various facets  of the drug industry in india. one of the terms of reference was  to examine the measures taken so far to reduce prices of drugs for the consumer  and to recommend such further measures as may be necessary to rationalise the prices of basic drugs and formulations. the hathi committee noticed that  in a country like india where general poverty and the wide disparities in levels of income between different sections existed  it was particularly important to emphasise  the social utility of the industry and the urgent need for extending as rapidly as possible certain minimum facilities in terms of preventive and curative medicines to the large mass of people both urban and rural. it was said   the concern about drug prices  therefore  really arises from the fact that many of them are essential to the health and welfare of the community  and that there is no justification for the drug industry charging prices and having a production pattern which is based not upon the needs of the community but on aggressive marketing tactices and created demand. the government of india accepted the report of the hathi committee and announced in parliament the  statement on drug policy  pursuant to which the drugs  prices control  order  1970 was repealed and the drugs  prices control. order  1979 was made. paragraph 44 of the statement on drug policy in 1978 dealt with  pricing policy  and it may be usefully extracted here. it was as follows. the hathi committee had recommended that a return post tax between 12 to 14  on equity that is paid up capital plus reserves  may be adopted as the basis for price fixation  depending on the importance and complexity of the bulk drug. in the case of formulations  the hathi committee felt that the principle of selectivity could be introduced in terms of  a  the size of the units   b  selection of items  and  c  controlling the prices only of market leaders  in particular  of products for which price control is contemplated. the hathi committee considered that units  other than mrtp units  having only turnover of less than rs 1 crore may be exempted from price control. alternatively  all formulations  other than those marketed under generic names  which have an annual sale in the country in excess of rs 15 lakhs  inclusive of excise duty  may be subjected to price control  irrespective of whether or not the total annual turnover of the unit is in excess of rs 1 crore. the ceiling price will be determined taking into account the production costs and a reasonable return for the units which are the market leaders. yet another variant of a selectivity  according to the hathi committee  would be to identify product groups which individually are important and which collectively constitute the bulk of the output of the industry. in respect of each item of this list  it would be possible to identify the leading producers who account for about 60  of the sales between them. on the basis of cost analysis in respect of those units  maximum prices may be prescribed and all other units may be free to fix their prices within this ceiling. on balance  the hathi committee was of the view that this particular variant selectivity may be administratively simpler. the distinction between an essential bulk drug included in the schedule and a bulk drug not so included in the schedule  which was made in 1970 drugs  prices control. order was abandoned in the 1979 order. bulk drugs were  however  broadly divided into indigenously manufactured bulk drugs  imported bulk drugs and hulk drugs which were both manufactured indigenously as also imported. this means that until the maximum sale price of an indigenously manufactured bulk drug is fixed under paragraph 3 of the 1979 order  the price fixed under paragraph 4 of the 1970 order or the price permitted under paragraph 5 of the 1970 order was to be maximum sale price. paragraph 3 4  a  requires a manufacturer commencing production of the bulk drug specified in the first or second schedule  the price of which has already been notified by the government  not to sell the bulk drug at a price exceeding the notified price. paragraph 3 4  b  provides that where the price of a bulk drug has not been notified by the government  the manufacturer shall  within 14 days of the commencement of the the production of such bulk drug  make an application to the government in form i and intimate the government the price at which he intends to sell the bulk drug and the government may  after making such an enquiry as it thinks fit  by order  fix a provisional price at which such bulk drug shall be sold. paragraph 4 is thus in the nature of an exception to paragraph 3. it is meant to provide a fillip to individual manufacturers of bulk drugs whose production it is necessary to increase. retention price  by its very definition pertains to individual manufacturers. common sale price  we take it  is the price at which manufacturers whose retentions are fixed may sell the bulk drug despite the maximum sale price fixed under paragraph 3. we are unable to agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents either with regard to the applicability of the principles of natural justice or with regard to the nature and the scope of the enquiry and review contemplated by paragraphs 3 and 27 while making our preliminary observations  we pointed out that price fixation is essentially a legislative activity though in rare circumstances  as in the case of a compulsory sale to the government or its nominee  it may assume the character  of an administrative or quasijudicial activity. nothing in the scheme of the drugs  prices control. order induces us to hold that price fixation under the drugs  prices control. order is not a legislative activity  but a quasi judicial activity which would attract the observance of the principles of natural justice. nor is there anything in the scheme or the provisions of the drugs  prices control  order which otherwise contemplates the observance of any principle of natural justice or kindred rule  the non observance of which would give rise to a cause of action to a suitor. what the order does contemplate however is  such enquiry  by the government  as it thinks fit. a provision for  such enquiry  as it thinks fit  by a subordinate legislating body  we have explained earlier  is generally an enabling provision to facilitate the subordinate legislating body to obtain relevant information from any source and it is not intended to vest any right in any body other than the subordinate legislating body. in the present case  the enquiry contemplated by paragraph 3 of drugs  prices control. order is to be made for the purposes of fixing the maximum price at which a bulk drug may be sold  with a view to regulating its equitable distribution and making it available at a fair price. the primary object of the enquiry is to secure the bulk drug at a fair price for the benefit of the ultimate consumer an object designed to fulfil the mandate of art. 39 b  of the constitution. it is primarily from the consumer public s point of view that the government is expected to make its enquiry. the need of the consumer public is to be ascertained and making the drug available to them at a fair price is what it is all about. the enquiry is to be made from that angle and directed towards that end. so  information may be gathered from whatever source considered desirable by the government. the enquiry  obviously is not to be confined to obtaining information from the manufacturers only and indeed must go beyond. however  the interests of the manufacturers are not to be ignored. in fixing the price of a bulk drug  the government is expressly required by the order to take into account the average cost of production of such bulk drug manufactured by  an efficient manufacturer  and allow a reasonable return on  net worth. for this purpose too  the government may gather information from any source including the manufacturers. here again the enquiry by the government need not be restricted to  an efficient manufacturer  or some manufacturers  nor need it be extended to all manufacturers. what is necessary is that the average cost of production by  an efficient manufacturer  must be ascertained and a reasonable return allowed on  net worth. such enquiry as it thinks fit is an enquiry in which information is sought from whatever source considered necessary by the enquiring body and is different from an enquiry in which an opportunity is required to be given to persons likely to be affected. the former is an enquiry leading to a legislative activity while the latter is an enquiry which ends in an administrative or quasi judicial decision. the enquiry contemplated by paragraph 3 of the drug  prices control. order is an enquiry of the former character. the legislative activity being a subordinate or delegated legislative activity  it must necessarily comply with the statutory conditions if any  no more and no less  and no implications of natural justice can be read into it unless it is a statutory condition. notwithstanding that the price fixation is a legislative activity  the subordinate legislation had taken care here to provide for a review. the review provided by paragraph 27 of the order is akin to a post decisional hearing which is sometimes afforded after the making of some administrative orders  but not truly so. it is a curious amalgam of a hearing which occasionally precedes a subordinate legislative activity such as the fixing of municipal rates etc. that we mentioned earlier and a post decision hearing after the making of an administrative or quasi judicial order. it is a hearing which follows a subordinate legislative activity intended to provide an opportunity to affected persons such as the manufacturers  the industry and the consumer public to bring to the notice of the subordinate legislating body the difficulties or problems experienced or likely to be experienced by them consequent on the price fixation  whereupon the government may make appropriate orders. any decision taken by the government cannot be confined to the individual manufacturer seeking review but must necessarily affect all manufacturers of the bulk drug as well as the consumer public. since the maximum price of a bulk drug is required by paragraph 3 to be notified any fresh decision taken in the proceeding for review by way of modification of the maximum price has to be made by a fresh notification fixing the new maximum price of the bulk drug. in other words  the review if it is fruitful must result in fresh subordinate legislative activity. the true nature of the review provided by paragraph 27 in so far as it relates to the fixation of maximum price of bulk drugs under paragraph 3 leader price and prices of formulations under paragraphs 12 and 13 is hard to define. it is difficult to give it a label and to fit it into a pigeon hole  legislative  administrative or quasi judicial. nor is it desirable to seek analogies and look to distant cousins for guidance. from the scheme of the control order and the context and content of paragraph 27  the review in so far as it concerns the orders under paragraph 3  12 and 13 appears to be in the nature of a legislative review of legislation  or more precisely a review of subordinate legislation by a subordinate legislating body at the instance of an aggrieved person. once we have ascertained the nature and character of the review  the further question regarding the scope and extent of the review is not very difficult to answer. the reviewing authority has the fullest freedom and discretion to prescribe its own procedure and consider the matter brought before it so long as it does not travel beyond the parameters prescribed by paragraph 3 in the case of a review against an order under paragraph 3 and the respective other paragraphs in the case of other orders. but whatever procedure is adopted  it must be a procedure tuned to the situation. manufacturers of any bulk drug are either one or a few in number and generally they may be presumed to be well informed persons  well able to take care of themselves  who have the assistance of accountants  advocates and experts to advise and espouse their cause. in the context of the drug industry with which we are concerned and in regard to which the control order is made we must proceed on the basis that the manufacturers of bulk drugs are generally persons who know all that is to be known about the price fixed by the government. from the legislative nature of the activity of the government  it is clear that the government is under no obligation to make any disclosure of any information received and considered by it in making the order but in order to render effective the right to seek a review given to an aggrieved person we think that the government  if so requested by the aggrieved manufacturer is under an obligation to disclose any relevant information which may reasonably be disclosed pertaining to  the average cost of production of the bulk drug manufactured by an efficient manufacturer  and  the reasonable return on net worth. for example  the manufacturer may require the government to give information regarding the particulars detailed in form no  1 of the fourth schedule which have been taken into account and those which have been excluded. the manufacturer may also require to be informed the elements which were taken into account and those which were excluded in assessing the  free reserves  entering into the calculation of  net worth. these particulars which he may seek from the government are mentioned by us only by way of illustration. he may seek any other relevant information which the government shall not unreasonably deny. that we think is the nature and scope of the review contemplated by paragraph 27 in relation to orders made under paragraphs 3  12 and 13. we mentioned that the price fixed by the government may be questioned on the ground that the considerations stipulated by the order as relevant were not taken into account. it may also be questioned on any ground on which a subordinate legislation may be questioned  such as  being contrary to constitutional or other statutory provisions. it may be questioned on the ground of a denial of the right guaranteed by art. 14 if it is arbitrary  that is  if either the guidelines prescribed for the determination are arbitrary or if  even though the guidelines are not arbitrary  the guidelines are worked in an arbitrary fashion. there is no question before us that paragraph 3 prescribes any arbitrary guideline. it was  however  submitted that the guidelines were not adhered to and that facts and figures were arbitrarily assumed. we do not propose to delve into the question whether there has been any such arbitrary assumption of facts and figures. we think that if there is any grievance on that score  the proper thing for the manufacturers to do is bring it to the notice of the government in their applications for review. the learned counsel argued that they were unable to bring these facts to the notice of the government as they were not furnished the basis on which the prices were fixed. on the other hand  it has been pointed out in the counter affidavits filed on behalf of the government that all necessary and required information was furnished in the course of the hearing of the review applications and. there was no justification for the grievance that particulars were not furnished. we are satisfied that the procedure followed by the government in furnishing the requisite particulars at the time of the hearing of the review applications is sufficient compliance with the demands of fair play in the case of the class of persons claiming to be affected by the fixation of maximum price under the drugs  prices control  order. as already stated by us  manufacturers of bulk drugs who claim to be affected by the drugs  prices control. order  belong to a class of persons who are well and fully informed of every intricate detail and particular which is required to be taken into account in determining the price. in most cases  they are the sale manufacturers of the bulk drug and even if they are not the sole manufacturers  they belong to the very select few who manufacture the bulk drug. it is impossible to conceive that they cannot sit across the table and discuss item by item with the reviewing authority unless they are furnished in advance full details and particulars. the affidavits filed on behalf of the union of india show that the procedure which is adopted in hearing the review applications is to discuss across the table the various items that have been taken into account. we do not consider that there is anything unfair in the procedure adopted by the government. if necessary it is always open to the manufacturers to seek a short adjournment of the hearing of the review application to enable them to muster more facts and figures on their side. indeed we find that the hearing given to the manufacturers is often protected. as we said we do not propose to examine this question as we do not want to constitute ourselves into a court of appeal over the government in the matter of price fixation. as we pointed out earlier  these are all matters which should legitimately be raised in the review application  if there is any substance in them. these are not matters for investigation in a petition under art. 226 of the constitution or under art. 32 of the constitution. despite the pressing invitation of shri diwan to go into facts and figures and his elaborate submissions based on facts and figures  we have carefully and studiously refrained from making any reference to such facts and figures as we consider it outside our province to do so and we do not want to set any precedent as was supposed to have been done in premier automobiles though it was not so done and  therefore  needed explanation in later cases. we think that the question has to be decided with reference to the definition of  free reserve  in paragraph 2 g  of the control order and not on any assumed principle of accountancy. this is also a question which may be raised before the government in the review application. referring to the  proforma  attached to form no  1 of the fourth schedule in which are set out several items which have to be taken into account in assessing the cost of production  the learned counsel attacks the notes at the end of item no  14 which mentions the various items of expenses to be excluded in ascertaining the cost. the notes is as follows    notes   i  items of expenses to be excluded from costs   a  bonus in excess of statutory minimum. b  bad debts and provisions. c  donations and charities. d  loss gain on sale of assets. e  brokerage and commission. f  expenses not recognized by income tax authorities  salary prequisities  advertisements  etc. g  adjustments relating to previous years. it was open to the subordinate legislating body to prescribe and adopt its own mode of ascertaining the cost of production and the items to be included and excluded in so doing. the subordinate legislating body was under no obligation to adopt the method adopted by the income tax authorities in allowing expenses for the purpose of ascertaining income and assessing it. there may be many items of business expenditure which may be allowed by income tax authorities as legitimate expenses but which can never enter the cost of production. so long as the method prescribed and adopted by the subordinate legislating body is not arbitrary and opposed to the principal statutory provisions  it cannot be legitimately questioned. we are unable to say that the subordinate legislating authority acted unreasonably in prescribing the norms in the manner it has done. while on the question on formulations  we would like to refer to the  oration  of dr  n h  antia at the 24th annual convocation of the national academy of medical sciences where he posed the question   why do we produce 60 000 formulations of drugs worth rs 2 500 crores which reach only 20  of the population when who recommends only 258 drugs and rs 750 crores worth would suffice for all our people if used in an ethical manner. we do not see any force in the submission. we think that it is the necessary duty of the government to proceed to fix the retail price of a formulation as soon as the price of the parent bulk drug is fixed. price fixation of a formulation is no doubt dependant on the price of the bulk drug  but it is not to await the result of a review application which in the end may turn out to be entirely without substance. if a review application is allowed and the price of the bulk drug is raised and if in the meanwhile  the formulation had been ordered to be sold at a low price  it may result in considerable loss to the manufacturer. but on the other hand  if the review application turns out to be entirely without substance and has to be rejected and if in the meanwhile the formulation is allowed to be sold at a higher price  the consumer public suffers. hus  the ups and downs of commerce are inevitable and it is not possible to devise a fool proof system to take care of every possible defect and objection. it is certainly not a matter at which the court could take a hand. all that the court may do is to direct the government to dispose of the review application expeditiously according to a time bound programme. all that the government may do is to dispose of the review application with the utmost expedition. but as we perceive the public interest  it is necessary that the price of formulation should be fixed close on the heels of the fixation of bulk drug price. 56. another submission of shri diwan was that there was considerable delay in the disposal of the review applications by the government and that even now no orders had been passed in several cases. accordingly to the learned counsel  the very delay in the disposal of review applications was sufficient to vitiate the entire proceeding and scheme of price fixation. according to the learned counsel  the price of a bulk drug is dependant on many variable factors which keep changing very fast. if time is allowed to lapse whatever price is fixed  it soon becomes out of date. if review applications are not disposed of expeditiously the notifications fixing the prices must be struck down as having become obsolete. it is difficult to agree with these propositions. it is true that the price of a bulk drug is dependent on innumerable variables. but it does not follow that the notification fixing the maximum price must necessarily be struck down as obsolete by the mere passage of time. we agree that applications for review must be dealt with expeditiously and whenever they are not so dealt with  the aggrieved person may seek a mandamus from the court to direct the government to deal with the review application within a time framework. we notice that in all these matters  the high court granted stay of implementation of the notifications fixing the maximum prices of bulk drugs and the retail prices of formulations. we think that in matter of this nature  where prices of essential commodities are fixed in order to maintain or increase supply of the commodities or for securing the equitable distribution and availability at fair prices of the commodity  it is not right that the court should make any interim order staying the implementation of the notification fixing the prices. we consider that such orders are against the public interest and ought not to be made by a court unless the court is satisfied that no public interest is going to be served. no doubt the order as made on november 25  1981 has the manufacturers on terms  but the consumer public has been left high and dry. their interests have in no way been taken care of. in matters of fixation of price  it is the interest of the consumer public that must come first and any interim order must take care of that interest. we do not agree with this submission. apart from the fact that an appeal is ordinarily considered to be a continuation of the original proceeding  in the present case  we notice that further orders of the supreme court were also in contemplation and such further orders could only be if appeals were preferred to the supreme court. we do not think that there was any doubt in anyone s mind that the matter would be taken up in appeal to the supreme court whichever way the writ petitions were decided. we are of the view that the undertakings given by the parties in the present cases were intended to and do continue to subsist. on the conclusions arrived at by us we have no doubt that the appeal must be allowed and the writ petition in the high court dismissed. however  we think that it is necessary to give a direction to the government to dispose of the review applications after giving a notice of hearing to the manufacturer. the hearing may be given within two months from today and the review application disposed of within two weeks after the conclusion of the hearing. any information sought by the manufacturer may be given to him at the hearing in terms of what we have said in the judgment. it appears that although several writ petitions filed by different manufacturers were disposed of by the high court by a common judgment  the union of india filed an appeal within the prescribed period of limitation against one of the manufacturers  cynamide india limited only. this was apparently done under some misapprehension that it would be enough if a single appeal was filed. later when it was realized that separate appeals were necessary  the union of india filed petitions for special leave to appeal against the other manufacturers also. as these petitions were filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation  petitions for condoning the delay in filing the petitions for special leave to appeal had to be and were filed. these applications are strenuously opposed by the manufacturers who contend the ordinary rule which is enforced in cases of delay namely that everyday s delay must be properly explained should also be rigorously enforced against the government. it is contended that the government is a well verse litigant as compared with private litigants and even if there is justification of adopting a liberal approach in condoning delay in the case of private litigants there was no need to adopt such approach in the case of the government. in cases like the present where parties have acted on the assumption that no appeals had been filed against them and have proceeded to arrange their affairs accordingly it would be unjust to condone the delay in filing the appeals at the instance of the government. though we see considerable force in the submission of shri diwan  we think that the circumstances of the instant cases do justify the exercise of our discretion to condone the delay. two important features have weighed with us in condoning the delay. one is that all the writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment and an appeal had been filed in the principal case. the other is that it is a  matter of serious concern to the public interest.

[Facts] accused pathan hussain basha was married to pathan haseena begum  now deceased  on 23rd june 2002 at guntur. it was an arranged marriage. at the time of marriage it was promised that a dowry of rs 25 000   besides other formalities would be paid by the side of the wife to the husband. out of this amount a sum of rs 15 000 was paid at that time and it was promised that the balance dowry of rs 10 000 would be paid in the month of october 2002 upon which the marriage was performed. the father of the bride could not pay the balance amount within time because he lacked the resources. the accused pathan hussain basha his father pathan khadar basha and mother pathan nazeer abi forced her to get the balance amount of dowry. despite such pressure she was not able to get that money from her family. it is the case of the prosecution that for non payment of dowry the accused persons harassed the deceased and subjected her to cruelty. they even refused to send her to her parental house. this was informed by the deceased to various persons including her relatives and elders. she was unable to bear the cruelty to which she was subjected by the accused persons. on 15th february 2003 at about 11 a m  the deceased committed suicide by hanging herself in the house of the accused. when pathan basheerunnisa lw3 returned from her work the accused sent her out giving her money to bring the soaps upon which she went out and when she came back she found the accused absent and the bride hanging in the house. subsequently lw 3 pathan basheerunnisa sent her grandson pathan inayatullah khan lw 4 to the house of the parents of the deceased to inform them about the incident. when the parents of the deceased came to the house of the accused and found the deceased hanging from the beam with a saree they untied her and took her to the government general hospital guntur hoping that the deceased may be alive. however upon medical examination by the doctor she was declared brought dead. the father of the deceased pathan yasin khan lw 1 and her mother pathan shamshad begum lw 2 were present at that time. lw 1 lodged the report which was registered by sri k srinivasarao lw 16 the sub inspector of police. the fir was registered under section 304b and section 498a of the indian penal code 1860  for short the  ipc   thereafter investigation was conducted by one shri p devadass lw 17 he inspected the site from where he recovered and seized the saree that had been used for hanging. this was done in the presence of lw 10 and lw 11 shaik ibrahim and mohd. ghouse respectively. thereupon the body was sent for postmortem examination through constable p venkateswara reddy lw 15 lw 17 p devdass also took photographs of the scene 3 lw 13 dr. m madhusudana reddy conducted autopsy over the body of the deceased and prepared post mortem certificate giving the cause of death as asphyxia as a result of hanging. on 16th february 2003 at about 5 p m  investigating officer arrested all the three accused persons. they faced the trial and were convicted by learned sixth additional munsif magistrate guntur for committing an offence under sections 498a and 304b ipc. they were committed to the court of sessions guntur division guntur for such an offence. they faced the trial and the learned sessions judge vide its judgment dated 4th october 2004 found them guilty of the said offences and punished them as follows   hence a 1 to a 3 are sentenced to undergo r i for three years and further sentenced to pay a fine of rs 1 000 each  total fine amount rs 3 000    offence punishable u s 498 a ipc i d of the fine amount of rs 1000 to undergo si for 9 months. and further a 1 to a 3 are sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life for the offence u s 304 b ipc both the sentences shall run concurrently. the undergone remand period of a 1 to a 3 shall be set off u s 428 cr. p c m o 1 shall be destroyed after expiry of appeal time. the unmarked property if any shall be destroyed after expiry of appeal time. the judgment dated 4th october 2004 passed by the learned trial court was challenged in appeal before the high court. this gave rise to filing of the present appeals.
[Ratio of the decision] first and the foremost we must consider what is the evidence led by the prosecution to bring home the guilt of accused. accused were charged with offences under sections 498a and 304b of the ipc the fir in the present case was lodged by lw 1 who is the father of the deceased. according to this witness on 23rd january 2002 the marriage of his daughter was solemnised with accused pathan hussain basha and he had accepted to give rs 25 000 in marriage. he had given only rs 15 000 and had agreed to pay rs 10 000   after four months. this witness has further specifically stated that the said accused treated his daughter in a proper manner for about two months. in the marriage he had also given a gold chain a double bed an iron safe and other items. he had called his son in law accused no 1 to his house as per custom at that point the accused demanded a ceiling fan. a ceiling fan was lying with the witness and he gave that to his son in law however he protested the same on the ground that the old fan is not acceptable to him and he would like to have a new fan which was bought for rs 650 by the witness and given to his son in law. when he again invited his son in law and the mother in law of his daughter even then he had gifted some presents to them. the accused asked for rs 1 000 with a ring for the deceased. the witness could pay only rs 500 upon which the accused refused to take the deceased to the matrimonial home and went away. later on the accused came to fetch deceased. subsequently the motherin law of the deceased again demanded the balance dowry amount of rs 10 000   which he could not pay. his daughter after the ramzan festival had informed him that the accused persons were harassing her and were even beating and abusing her. all three accused used to beat her for the remaining amount of dowry. on 15th february 2003 a boy had come to him and told him that his daughter had died by hanging herself whereupon he went to the house of the accused and found that his daughter was hanged to a wooden beam with a saree and she was dead. the saree was removed she was taken to the hospital where she was reported to have  brought dead  the statement of this witness i e lw 1 is corroborated by lw 3 and lw 7. it is stated by lw 3 that she knew all the accused persons as she was residing in the house of the accused and the deceased. according to this witness also in the beginning they were happy however after some time she used to hear some quarrel between the deceased and the accused persons. accused no 2 pathan nazeer abi had given her some amount and asked her to go and bring the soaps. after bringing the soaps she went to the house of the accused persons and found that the accused was absent and the deceased was hanging on one side of the room. after seeing this she raised cries and people came to the scene. lw 4 pathan inayatullah khan the grandson of lw 3 went to the house of the parents of the deceased and informed them about the unfortunate incident. lw 7 stated on oath that he was present at the time of giving of dowry to the accused by the family of the deceased. he confirmed the fact that rs 15 000 was given at the time of marriage and rs 10 000 was to be given within some time which the father of the deceased failed to provide. according to him the accused persons used to harass the deceased primarily for non payment of the amount of dowry as a result of which she was forced to commit suicide. in fact there is no dispute to the fact that the deceased died of hanging. dr. m madhusudana reddy lw 13 who was the associate professor in forensic medicine at guntur medical college performed the post mortem over the body of the deceased. in the medical report lw13 he noticed  oblique ligature mark of 17 x 2 5 cm present over front and left sides of neck  as well as noticed  abrasion 1 5 x 1 cm present over lower part of middle of chin. injuries were found to be antemortem in nature and the cause of death was stated to be asphyxia as a result of hanging. lw 14 is a witness to the seizure of the body and she noticed injuries on the body of the deceased. from the above evidence it is clear that the dowry demands were being raised by the accused persons persistently from the family of the deceased and for that they even harassed the deceased by beating and abusing her. she had informed her parents of the ill treatment and the cruelty inflicted on her for non giving of dowry. the period intervening between the marriage and the death of the deceased is very small. they were married in the year 2002 and she committed suicide by hanging on 15th. february 2003 the witnesses including lw 1 have stated that for the first few months they were happy but thereafter there were quarrels between the accused and the deceased. accused pathan hussain basha when he had gone to the parental house of the deceased demanded different items like fan ring and rs 1 000 in cash and the balance of the agreed dowry amount. since these demands were not satisfied instantaneously he even left the deceased at her parental house. at this stage it will be appropriate for us to examine as to what are the ingredients of an offence punishable under section 304b of the ipc. besides examining the ingredients of the provision it would also be necessary for us to examine the meaning and connotation of the expressions  dowry death   soon before her death  and  in connection with any demand for dowry  as appearing in the said section. amongst others lapse of time between the date of marriage and the date of death is also a relevant consideration for the court while examining whether the essential ingredients of the provision are satisfied or not in a given case. from the above definition it is clear that  dowry  means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to another by parents of either party to each other or any other person at before or at any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr under the muslim personal law. all the expressions used under this section are of a very wide magnitude. the expressions  or any time after marriage  and  in connection with the marriage of the said parties  were introduced by the amending act 63 of 1984 and act 43 of 1986 with effect from 2 101985 and 19 11 1986 respectively. these amendments appear to have been made with the intention to cover all demands at the time before and even after the marriage so far they were in connection with the marriage of the said parties. this clearly shows the intent of the legislature that these expressions are of wide meaning and scope. the expression  in connection with the marriage  cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning. the expression  in connection with the marriage  even in common parlance and on its plain language has to be understood generally. the object being that everything which is offending at any time i e at before or after the marriage would be covered under this definition but the demand of dowry has to be  in connection with the marriage  and not so customary that it would not attract on the face of it the provisions of this section. the courts have also taken the view that where the husband had demanded a specific sum from his father in law and upon not being given harassed and tortured the wife and after some days she died such cases would clearly fall within the definition of  dowry  under the act. s 4 of the act is the penal section and demanding a  dowry  as defined under s 2 of the act is punishable under this section. as already noticed we need not deliberate on this aspect as the accused before us has neither been charged nor punished for that offence. we have examined the provisions of s 2 of the act in a very limited sphere to deal with the contentions raised in regard to the applicability of the provisions of section 304 b of the code. we have already referred to the provisions of section 304 b of the code and the most significant expression used in the section is  soon before her death  in our view the expression  soon before her death  cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning. they must be understood in their plain language and with reference to their meaning in common parlance. these are the provisions relating to human behaviour and therefore cannot be given such a narrower meaning which would defeat the very purpose of the provisions of the act of course these are penal provisions and must receive strict construction. but even the rule of strict construction requires that the provisions have to be read in conjunction with other relevant provisions and scheme of the act. further the interpretation given should be one which would avoid absurd results on the one hand and would further the object and cause of the law so enacted on the other. we are of the considered view that the concept of reasonable time is the best criteria to be applied for appreciation and examination of such cases. however the expression would normally imply that there has to be reasonable time gap between t he cruelty inflicted and the death in question. if this is so the legislature in its wisdom would have specified any period which would attract the provisions of this section. however there must be existence of proximate link between the acts of cruelty along with the demand of dowry and the death of the victim. for want of any specific period the concept of reasonable period would be applicable. thus the cruelty harassment and demand of dowry should not be so ancient whereafter the couple and the family members have lived happily and that it would result in abuse of the said protection. such demand or harassment may not strictly and squarely fall within the scope of these provisions unless definite evidence was led to show to the contrary. these matters of course will have to be examined on the facts and circumstances of a given case. the cruelty and harassment by the husband or any relative could be directly relatable to or in connection with any demand for dowry. the expression  demand for dowry  will have to be construed ejusdem generis to the word immediately preceding this expression. similarly  in connection with the marriage  is an expression which has to be given a wider connotation. it is of some significance that these expressions should be given appropriate meaning to avoid undue harassment or advantage to either of the parties. these are penal provisions but ultimately these are the social legislations intended to control offences relating to the society as a whole. dowry is something which existed in our country for a considerable time and the legislature in its wisdom considered it appropriate to enact the law relating to dowry prohibition so as to ensure that any party to the marriage is not harassed or treated with cruelty for satisfaction of demands in consideration and for subsistence of the marriage. the court cannot ignore one of the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence that a suspect in the indian law is entitled to the protection of art 20 of the constitution of india as well as has a presumption of innocence in his favour. in other words the rule of law requires a person to be innocent till proved guilty. the concept of deeming fiction is hardly applicable to the criminal jurisprudence. in contradistinction to this aspect the legislature has applied the concept of deeming fiction to the provisions of section 304 b where other ingredients of section 304 b are satisfied in that event the husband or all relatives shall be deemed to have caused her death. in other words the offence shall be deemed to have been committed by fiction of law. once the prosecution proves its case with regard to the basic ingredients of section 304 b the court will presume by deemed fiction of law that the husband or the relatives complained of has caused her death. such a presumption can be drawn by the court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under section 304 b of the code. applying these principles to the facts of the present case it is clear that the ingredients of section 304b read with section 498a ipc are completely satisfied in the present case. by a deeming fiction in law the onus shifts on to the accused to prove as to how the deceased died. it is for the accused to show that the death of the deceased did not result from any cruelty or demand of dowry by the accused persons. the accused did not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred. denial cannot be treated to be the discharge of onus. onus has to be discharged by leading proper and cogent evidence. it was expected of the accused to explain as to how and why his wife died as well as his conduct immediately prior and subsequent to the death of the deceased. maintaining silence cannot be equated to discharge of onus by the accused. in the present case the prosecution by reliable and cogent evidence has established the guilt of the accused. there being no rebuttal thereto there is no occasion to interfere in the judgments of the courts under appeal. the high court acquitted pathan khadar basha the fatherin law of the deceased as there was no direct evidence against him. his acquittal has not been challenged by the state before us thus we are not called upon to discuss this aspect of the matter. accused pathan hussain basha and pathan nazeer abi have rightly been found guilty of the offence by the courts. while we see no reason to differ with the concurrent findings recorded by the trial court and the high court we do see some substance in the argument raised on behalf of the appellants that keeping in view the prosecution evidence the attendant circumstances the age of the accused and the fact that they have already being in jail for a considerable period the court may take lenient view as far as the quantum of sentence is concerned. the offences having been proved against the accused and keeping in view the attendant circumstances we are of the considered view that ends of justice would be met if the punishment awarded to the appellants is reduced.

[Facts] this is an appeal on a certificate u art. 133 1  of theconstitution from a judgment and decree passed by the appellate bench of the high court of calcutta. modifying on appeal the judgment and decree passed by mr  justice bose on the original side of that court. one dwarka nath ghose was the owner of considerable moveable and immoveable properties. on the 10th june  1891  he made and published his last will and testament whereby he dedicated to this family idol. shree shree iswar sridhar jew his two immoveable properties  to wit. premises. no  41 and no  40 1. grey street in the city of calcutta. he appointed his two sons rajendra and jogendra executors of ms will and provided that his second wife golap sundari and the two sons rajendra and jogendra should perform the seva of the deity and on their death their heirs and successors would be entitled to perform the seva. dwarka nath died on the 16th march  1892  leaving him surviving his widow golap sundari and his two sons rajendra and jogendra. on the 19th july  1899  rajendra made and published his last will and  testament whereby he confirmed the dedication made by dwarka nath with regard to premises nos. 41 and 40 1 grey street and appointed his brother jogendra the sole executor thereof. he died on the 31st january 1900  and jogendra obtained on the 24th april  1900. probate of his said will. probate of the will of dwarka nath was also obtained by jogendra on the 31st august  1909. on the 4th september 1909  bhupendra  jnanendra  and nagendra  then a minor  the three sons of rajendra filed a suit  being suit no. 969 of 1909 on. the original side of the high court at calcutta against jogendra  golap sundari and padma dassi  the widow of sidheswar  another son of rajendra  for the construction of the wills of dwarka nath and rajendra  for partition and other reliefs. the idol was not made a party to this suit. the said suit was compromised and on the 24th november  1910  a consent decree was passed  whereby jogendra and golap sundari gave up their rights to the sevayatship and bhupendra  jnanendra and nagendra became the sevaits of the idol  a portion of the premises. 41 grey street was  allotted to the branch of rajendra and the remaining portion was allotted to jogendra absolutely and in consideration of a sum of rs. 6 500 to be paid to the plaintiffs  jogendra was declared entitled absolutely to the premises. no  40 1. the portions allotted to jogendra were subsequently numbered 40 2 a grey street and the portion of the premises. 41 grey street allotted to the branch of rajendra was subsequently numbered 41 a grey street. jogendra died on the 5th august  1911  leaving a will whereby he appointed his widow sushilabala the executrix thereof. she obtained probate of the will on the 6th august  1912. disputes arose between bhupendra  jnanendra and nagendra  the sons of rajendra  and one kedar nath ghosh was appointed arbitrator to settle those disputes. the arbitrator made his award dated the 12th october  1920  whereby he allotted premises no  41 a grey street  exclusively to nagendra as his share of the family properties. nagendra thereafter executed several mortgages of the said premises. the first mortgage was created by him in favour of snehalata dutt on the 19th may  1926. the second mortgage was executed on the 4th june  1926  and the third mortgage on the 22nd february  1927. on the 23rd february  1927  nagendra executed a deed of settlement of the said premises by which he appointed his wife labanyalata and his wife s brother samarendra nath mitter trustees to carry out the directions therein contained and in pursuance of the deed of settlement he gave up possession of the said premises in favour of the trustees. snehalata dutt filed in the year 1929 a suit  being suit no  1042 of 1929  against nagendra  the trustees under the said deed of settlement and the puisne mortgagees  for realisation of the mortgage security. a consent decree was passed in the said suit on the 9th september  1929. nagendra died in june  1931  and the said premises were ultimately put up for sale in execution of the mortgage decree and were purchased on the 9th december  1936  by hari charan dutt. hari pada. dutt and durga charan dutt for a sum of rs. 19 000. a petition made by the purchasers on the 12th january  1937  for setting aside the sale was rejected by the court on the 15th march  1937. haripada dutt died on the 3rd june  1941  leaving him surviving his three sons  pashupati nath dutt  shambhunath dutt and kashinath dutt  the appellants before us. haricharan dutt conveyed ms one third share in the premises to them on the 4th march 1944  and durga charan dutt conveyed his one third share to them on the 3rd may  1946. they thus became entitled to the whole of the premises which had been purchased at the auction sale held on the 9th december  1936. on the 19th july  1948  the family idol of dwarka nath  sree sree iswar sridhar jew  by its next friend debabrata ghosh  the son of nagendra  filed the suit  out of which the present appeal arises  against the appellants as  also against susilabala and the two sons of jogendra by her  amongst others  for a declaration that the premises nos. 41 a and 40 2 a. grey street  were its absolute properties and for possession thereof  for a declaration that the consent decree dated the 24th november  1910  in suit no. 969 of 1909 and the award dated the 12th october  1920  and the dealings made by the heirs of jogendra. and or rajendra relating to the said premises or any of them purporting to affect its rights in the said premises were invalid and inoperative in law and not binding on it  for an account of the dealings with the said premises  for a scheme of management of the debutter properties and for its worship  for discovery  receiver  injunction and costs. written statements were filed by the appellants and by susilabala and the two sons of jogendra denying the claims of the idol and contending inter alia that there was no valid or absolute dedication of the suit properties i to the idol and that the said premises had been respectively acquired by them by adverse possession and that the title of the idol thereto had been extinguished. the appellants filed on the 18th august  1950  an appeal against this judgment being appeal no  118 of 1950. the idol filed on the 20th november  1950  cross objections against the decree for rs. 19 000 and interest thereon as also the dismissal of the suit in regard to the premises. the appellants filed on the 31st may  1951  an application for leave to prefer an appeal to this court against the said judgment and decree of the high court at calcutta. a certificate u art. 133 1  of theconstitution was granted on the 4th june  1951  and the high court admitted the appeal finally on the 6th august  1951. on the 22nd november  1951  the idol applied to the high court for leave to file cross objections against that part of the judgment and decree of the high court which dismissed its claims with regard to the premises no 40 2 a grey street. by an order made by this court on the 24th may  1953  the petition of the idol for filing cross objections in this court was allowed to be treated as a petition for special leave to appeal against that part of the decree which was against it  subject to any question as to limitation. the appeal as also the petition for special leave to appeal mentioned above came on for hearing and final disposal before us. the appeal was argued but so far as the petition for special leave to appeal was concerned the parties came to an agreement whereby the idol asked for leave to withdraw the petition on certain terms recorded between the parties. the petition for special leave was therefore allowed to be withdrawn and no objection now survives in regard to the decree passed by the trial court dismissing the idol s claim to the premises  no  40 2 a.
[Ratio of the decision] grey street. the appeal is concerned only with the premises. no  41. the first contention of the appellants is clearly untenable on the very language of the will of dwarka nath. cl. 3 of the said will provided  with a view to provide a permanent habitation for the said deity  i do by means of this will  dedicate the aforesaid immovable property the said house. no  41 grey street together with land thereunder to the said sri sri issur sridhar jew. with a view to provide for the expenses of his daily  and  periodical sheba and festivals  etc. the 3 1 2 cattahs  three and half cattahs  of rent free land more or less that i have on that very. grey street no  40 1. his also i dedicate to the sheba of the said sri sri sridhar jew salagram sila thakur. on my demise none of my heirs and representatives shall ever be competent to take the income of the said land no  40 1 and spend  the same for household expenses. if there be any surplus left after defraying the debsheba expenses the same shall be credited to the said sridhar jew thakur s fund and with the amount so deposited repairs  etc  from time to time will be effected to the said house. no  41 with a view to preserve it and the taxes etc. in respect of the said two properties will be paid. for the purpose of the carrying on the daily  and  periodical sheba and the festivals  etc. of the said sri issur sridhar jew salagram sila thakur my said  second wife srimati golap moni dasi  and 1st sriman rajendara nath and 2nd  sriman jogendra nath ghose born of the womb of my first wife on living in the said house. no  41 grey street dedicated by me shall properly and agreeably to each other perform the sheba. etc. of the said sri sri issur sridhar jew salagram sila thakur and on the death of my said two sons their representatives  successors and heirs shall successively perform the sheba in the aforesaid manner and the executors appointed by this will of mine having got the said two properties registered in the calcutta municipality in the name of the said sri sri issur sridhar jew thakur shall pay the municipal taxes  etc. and shall take the municipal bills in his name. none of my representatives heirs  successors  executors  administrators or assigns shall have any manner of interest in or right to the said two debutter properties and no one shall ever be competent to give away or effect sale  mortgage or in respect of the said two properties nor shall the said two properties  be sold on account of the debts of any one. t is quite true that a dedication may be either absolute or partial. the property may be given out and out to the idol  or it may be subjected to a charge in favour of the idol. what we find here in cl. 3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises. grey street to the idol as its permanent habitation with only the right given to the sevayats to reside in the said premises for the purposes of carrying on the daily and periodical seva and the festivals  etc. of the deity. the said premises are expressly declared as dedicated to the deity. they are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the deity  the municipal bills have got to be taken also in his name and none of the testator s representatives  heirs  successors  executors  administrators or assigns is to have any manner of interest in or right to the said premises or is to be competent to give away or effect sale  mortgage  etc. of the said premises. there is thus a clear indication of the intention of the testator to absolutely dedicate the said premises to the deity and it is impossible to urge that there was a partial dedication of the premises to the deity. this argument however cannot avail the appellants. regards the second contention  viz   the adverse possession of nagendra  it is to be noted that under the terms of cl  3 of the will of dwarka nath the representatives  successors and heirs of his two sons rajendra and jogendra were successively to perform the seva in the manner therein mentioned and nagendra was one of the heirs and legal representatives of rajendra. he was no doubt a minor on the 24th november  1910  when the terms of settlement were arrived at between the parties to the suit 1909. his two elder brothers jnanendra and bhupendra were declared to be the then sevayats  but a right was reserved to nagendra to join with them as a sevayat on  his attaining majority. so far as nagendra is concerned there is a clear finding of fact recorded by mr  justice bose on a specific issue raised in that behalf  viz. did nagendra act as shebait of the plaintiff deity under the wills of dwarka nath ghosh and rajendra nath ghosh. that he did act as such shebait and that his possession of the premises. no  41a. grey street was referable to possession on behalf of the idol  30  this finding was not challenged in the appeal court and it is too late to challenge the same before us. if nagendra was thus a sevayat of the idol it could not be urged that his possession could in any manner whatever be adverse to the idol and his dealings with the said premises in the manner he purported to do after the 12th october  1920  could not be evidence of any adverse possession against the idol.

satturs and sticks arrived there in two auto rickshaws and one jeep. out of the accused a 5 a 6 a 8 a 10 and a 11 were carrying swords while a 7 and a 9 had satturs and the remaining accused were armed with sticks. on the arrival of accused party anna shetty ran away. appellants a 5 a 10 and a 11 thereafter assaulted bajrang band patte  pw 14  on his head in front of the hotel. they also assaulted baban karpe  pw 9  and popat deceased who had run away to the math after chasing them in the auto rickshaws and the jeep. it is alleged that a 5 a 10 and a 11 assaulted popat deceased with the swords on his head and thighs and when baban tried to intervene he was also assaulted and he received a blow with the sattur near his knee. he ran away to conceal himself. bajrang  pw 14  was taken to the hospital by waman pw 15 ramesh pw 11 and prakash pw 2 whereas popat deceased who was seriously injured and had fallen down unconscious after receipt of the injuries was removed to the hospital by the police when it arrived at the spot a little later. all the injured persons were admitted to the hospital. while receiving the treatment popat succumbed to his injuries. on receipt of information asstt. police inspector joshi arrived at the hospital and baban karpe pw 9 narrated the occurrence to him which was reduced into writing. on the basis of the said report an fir for offences under section 302 307 149 147 148 ipc was registered vide cr no 101 of 1990 at about 6 00 p m. the inquest on the dead body of popat was conducted and the body was sent for post mortem examination. bajrang pw 14 regained consciousness during the night intervening 11th and 12th august 1990 and made a statement to the police in respect of the incident which took place in front of jagdamba hotel and on the basis of that statement cr no 102 90 was registered. the jeep allegedly used by the accused party was later found in front of the house of accused baloba dombe a 1  who died subsequently  one sword stained with blood and two blood stained sticks were recovered from the said jeep. an auto rickshaw bearing registration no mwq 5624 belonging to manik bhende gavali was found abandoned in a damaged condition with broken glasses. it was also taken into possession vide a panchnama. the accused were searched for but could not be traced. they were subsequently arrested on different dates. on a disclosure statement made by a 11 before the police and the panches under section 27 of the evidence act and on his pointing out a sword was recovered from the field at korti where it lay buried. a 10 also made a disclosure statement under section 27 of the evidence act to the effect that he had buried a sword behind yamai tukai temple and could get it recovered. on the pointing out by a 10 the said sword was also recovered and taken into possession through a panchnama. during the investigation an identification parade was got conducted through the executive magistrate pw 32 when baban karpe  pw 9  and other prosecution witnesses identified the assailants. samples of blood of the accused were collected for ascertaining their blood groups and sent for chemical analysis. the blood samples of bajrang  pw 14  and baban karpe  pw 9  were similarly collected. the blood stained clothes of the deceased and the injured persons as also the swords were sent to the chemical examiner for analysis. after completion of the investigation two charge sheets arising out of crime no 101 90 and crime no 102 90 were filed before the designated court. during the pendency of the two charge sheets the addl. public prosecutor through an application ex. p 35 requested the court for holding trial in respect of both the chargesheets together which application was allowed by the designated court vide order dated 5 december 1992 and that is how both the cases were tried together by virtue of the provisions of section 220  1  cr. p c  as the series of acts in both the cases were so inter connected as to form one transaction. the learned judge of the designated court acquitted a 2 a 3 a 4 a 6 a 7 and a 12 of the offences charged against them apparently influenced by the lack of identification of these accused persons by the prosecution witnesses at the identification parade conducted by the executive magistrate. the appellants however were convicted and sentenced in the manner as already noticed. we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. pw 9 was examined by dr. khiste pw 22 who noticed the following two injuries on his person   1  transverse superficial incised wound 10x1 2 cm on posterior of left knee in popliteal. edges were clean out. 2  abraded contusion below right knee and front of right leg 5 x 5 cm. pw 14 bajrang was also medically examined and the following injuries were found on him     1. transverse lacerated would on occipital region 3 x 1 cm  bone deep. injury was bleeding fresh. 2  multiple abraded contusion all over the back. the defence plea of total denial and false implication has been rightly rejected by the designated court in view of the over whelming cogent and reliable prosecution evidence. the trial court for the purposes of consideration of the evidence divided the prosecution case into three parts namely   i  the incident at vrindavan video parlour  ii  incident near jagdamba hotel and  iii  the incident at the math. so far as the first incident is concerned that merely provided the motive for the assault near the jagdamba hotel and the math. the evidence regarding the first incident was given by pw10 pw11 and pw12 these witnesses deposed that while they were watching a movie at the video parlour a 11 a 6 and a 10 alongwith one other person had occupied the seats in the row behind them and when the leg of a 11 dashed against the leg of pw10 who told him to keep his leg properly a 11 started abusing him in filthy language and threatened him that he would  deal  with him. in view of the altercation the complainants left the video parlour and went towards jagdamba hotel. some of the prosecution witnesses including the deceased pw9 and pw14 were already standing near the jagdamba hotel. pw10 narrated the incident of the video parlour to those persons and in the meantime the accused party arrived there in a jeep and two auto rickshaws and started assaulting the complainant party. however according to the prosecution evidence itself during the assault none out of the four prosecution witnesses with whom the altercation had taken place at the video parlour was injured. near the jagdamba hotel it was bajrang pw 14 who received the injuries at the hands of the accused. some of the other witnesses including popat deceased and baban pw 9 fled towards the math to save themselves. the evidence of pw10 pw 11 and pw 12 has received ample corroboration from the testimony of pw 9 pw 13 pw 14 and pw 15 who deposed that while the witnesses were narrating the incident of the video parlour to waman band patte pw 15 and other witnesses present there the accused party arrived in a jeep and two auto rickshaws variously armed and opened an attack on the complainant party with a view to teach them a lesson for the altercation which had taken place earlier at the video parlour. to connect the accused with the incidents near the jagdamba hotel and the math the prosecution has examined pw3 pw4 pw9 pw10 pw11 pw12 pw13 and pw14 besides pw7 pw20 and pw21 the last three witnesses however turned hostile at the trial and were cross examined by the addl. public prosecutor with the permission of the court. out of the remaining witnesses mentioned above pw 9. and pw 14 are the injured witnesses. these are thus the stamped witnesses whose presence admits of no doubt and being themselves the victims they would not leave out the real assailants and substitute them with innocent persons. pw 15 waman band patte who is the owner of the jagdamba hotel has lent sufficient corroboration to the testimony of the other prosecution witnesses in general and pw9 and pw14 in particular. from the testimony of pw9 it stands established that while mukesh pw 12 was narrating the incident which had taken place at the video parlour the appellants alongwith 7 8 other persons arrived in a jeep and two auto rickshaws armed with swords satturs and sticks and opened the assault on the prosecution witnesses and that a 11 and his two associates assaulted pw 14 with swords. these witnesses knew the accused from before by their names and had also identified them later when called upon to do so. they specifically described the roles played by a 5 a 10 and a 11 pw 10 pw 11 pw 12 pw 13 pw 14 and pw 15 also spoke about the presence of a 1 a 8 and a 9 with their respective weapons alongwith a 5 a 10 and a 11 near the jagdamba hotel at the time of assault on pw 14. an identification parade had been held by shri shrikant chimanaji jahagirdar  pw 32  executive magistrate. at the identification parade a 5 was identified by pw 9 pw10 pw 11 pw 14 and pw 15  a 10 by pws 10 to 15  a 11 by pw 3 and pws 9 to 15  a 1 by pws 10 to 15  a 8 and a 9 by pw 3 and by pws 10 to 15. so far as other accused are concerned none of the prosecution witnesses ascribed any role to a 2 a 3 and a 12 and even though pw 15 deposed at the trial about the presence of a 4 a 6 and a 7 and stated that they were present with the accused party but the trial court for good and sufficient reasons found that his testimony as regards their presence in the unlawful assembly had not received trustworthy corroboration from any other prosecution evidence. the learned designated court opined that though the identity of a 1  since dead  a 5 a 8 a 9 a 10 and a 11 as the assailants had been established by the prosecution evidence beyond a reasonable doubt the same could not be said about the participation of the remaining accused. the victims it appears from the record belong to the wadar community.
[Ratio of the decision] through this appeal under section 19 of tada the appellants have called in question their conviction and sentence. that the incident arose out of a petty altercation between a 11 and his three companions with pw 10 and his three companions at the video parlour and later on led in the homicidal death of popat band patte on 11 august 1990 and injuries to pw9 and pw14 was neither disputed before the learned designated court nor before us. from the post mortem report prepared by dr. a p khiste. pw 22  we find that the deceased had four incised injuries which had caused extensive damage to his internal organs also. according to pw 22 the internal injuries on the deceased were a result of the following external injuries   1  incised wound transverse on left groin at centre medial to left public symphysis and left superior iliac crest all muscles vessels cut both femoral vessels vein artery cut dimension 4 x 2 x 5 cms. transverse incised wound on right parital region bone deep 4 x 2 x 1 cms  6. cms above right ear fracture of right parietal bone with laceration of brain. 3  verticle incised wound 5 x 1 x 1 cms  bone deep at centre of vertex fracture of skull with laceration of brain. pw 22 opined that these injuries individually as well as collectively were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. we do not find any force in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that since mohan lal pw 19 who runs the video parlour has not fully supported the prosecution version regarding the cause of altercation at the video parlour the genesis of the occurrence gets shrouded in doubt. pw 19 was declared hostile by the prosecution and was cross examined by the addl. public prosecutor. we find from a careful analysis of the evidence that the testimony of pw9 to pw 15 regarding the incident at the video parlour is cogent and trustworthy and nothing has been brought out during the cross examination of these witnesses which may cast any doubt about the correctness of the version given by them regarding the incident at the video parlour. even from the evidence of the hostile witness pw 19 mohanlal it emerges that on the day of the incident there was an altercation at the video parlour though he has given the cause of the altercation to be somewhat different which explanation does not appeal to us. even if for the sake of argument we were to ignore the evidence of pw19 it would not materially affect the prosecution case in so faras the incident at the video parlour is concerned. we are in agreement with the designated court that there is ample evidence led by the prosecution to establish the incident at the video parlour and also that the said incident was the origin for the subsequent assault. his testimony receives ample corroboration from the testimony of pw10 pw11 pw14 and pw15 waman the proprietor of jagdamba hotel besides the medical evidence. these witnesses categorically deposed that a 5 a 10 and a 11 were responsible for causing injuries to bajrang pw 14. we agree. from our independent analytical appreciation of the evidence on the record we are of the opinion that the designated court rightly found the participation of a 1 a 5 a 8 a 9 and a 11 in the assault to have been positively established. however so far as a 10 is concerned we find that there is merit in the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant that his identify and participation in the assault has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt. baban karpe pw 9 himself an injured witness failed to identify a 10 at the time of the identification parade held by pw 32 though he identified a 10 later on in the court during the trial. that apart the name of a 10 does not figure specifically in the statement of baban pw 9 which formed the basis of the fir ex 77 pw 10 pw 11 and pw 15 have tried to implicate a 10 by making tell tale improvements in their statements at the trial by ascribing a role to him in the assault by improving upon their statements earlier recorded during the investigation with which statements they were duly confronted. even bajrang pw 14 who is an injured witness himself and deposed about the incident at jagdamba hotel with sufficient details appears to have exaggerated the version when he stated that he had been assaulted by a 10 also besides a 5 and a 11 auite contrary to his earlier statement. there is only one injury which was received by pw 14 and according to the other prosecution witnesses that injury had been caused to him by a 11 the tendency to exaggerate the incident is not uncommon and that an innocent person may be roped in alongwith the guilty ones is a possibility which cannot in the facts and circumstances of this case be ruled out. in view of the improvement made by the prosecution witnesses at the trial from their earlier statements and the infirmities already noticed we are of the opinion that it cannot be said with any amount of certainty that the participation of a 10 in the assault or even his presence in the unlawful assembly at the time of the assault near jagdamba hotel or the math has been substantiated. the prosecution has not been able to establish the case against a 10 beyond a reasonable doubt and is our opinion he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. in so far as the remaining appellants are concerned the evidence of the eye witnesses and particularly of pw 3 and pws 9 to 14 unmistakably connects them with the assault on the complainant party near the jagdamba hotel and at the math resulting in the death of popat and injuries being caused to pw9 and pw14 despite searching cross examination nothing has been brought out in their cross examination from which any doubt may arise about the participation of a 1 a 5 a 8 a 9 and a 11 in the assault or discredit the testimony of any of these witnesses. their evidence establishes the manner in which the assault originated as well as the role played by each one of them. the appellants  other than a10  were as already noticed identified by various prosecution witnesses at the identification parade held by pw 32 the executive magistrate also. besides the testimony of these prosecution witnesses has received ample corroboration from the medical evidence as well as the recoveries of the weapons of offence. from our independent examination of the material on the record we are satisfied that the prosecution has been able to establish its case against a 5 a 8 a 9 and a 11 and the deceased a 1 beyond a reasonable doubt. that takes us now to consider the nature of the offence committed by a 5 a 8 a 9 and a 11. in our opinion the designated court fell in error in holding that an offence under section 3 of tada had been committed by the accused appellants in the established facts and circumstances of this case. merely because the deceased and the two injured witnesses belong to wadar community no inference could be drawn that the attack by the appellants on them was intended to strike terror in a section of the society namely the wadar community. there is no basis for such an assumption. prosecution has led no evidence in that behalf either. it appears to be a mere coincidence that pw9 pw14 and the deceased all belong to the  wadar community  there is nothing on the record to disclose as to which community do the appellants belong to or what grievance they had against the  wadar community  by no stretch of imagination. can it be said that the accused had the intention to strike terror much less in a particular section of the society when they entered into an altercation at the video parlour or even when they went after the complainant party and opened an assault on then opposite jagdamba hotel or at the math. none out of those who were present at the video parlour received any injury and there is no material on the record to show as to which community did they belong to either. prosecution has led no evidence nor brought any circumstances on the record from which any inference may be drawn that the appellants intended to strike terror amongst the  wadar community  it was not proper for the designated court to draw an inference of intention from the mere consequence i e  the victims belonging to the particular community. the learned trial court appears to have ignored to take into consideration the essential requirements for establishing an offence under section 3 of tada. appellants no 1  a 5  2  a 8  3  a 9  and. 5  a 11  had alongwith the deceased accused a 1 and some others about whose identity there has been some doubt formed an unlawful assembly and in furtherance of the common object of that assembly committed the murder of popat deceased besides causing injuries to pw9 and pw14. in the result the appeal succeeds insofar as a 10  appellant no 4  is concerned. he is given the benefit of doubt and acquitted of all the charges against him. he shall be released from custody forthwith if not required in any other case. the conviction and sentence of appellants no 1 2 3 and 5 for the offence under section 3 tada is also set aside but their conviction and sentence for the other offences as recorded by the designated court is upheld and to that extent their appeals fail. a bare perusal of the above section shows that an appeal against the judgment sentence or order of the designated court  except an interlocutory order  shall lie on facts and on law to the supreme court and that no appeal or revision shall lie to any other court. in the face of this express provision there is no scope to urge that the appeal may be transferred to the high court because of the acquittal of the appellants for the offence punishable under section 3 tada by us. in a case where the designated court finds that no offence under tada is made out it is open to the said court to transfer the case to the regular criminal court under section 18 tada but once the charge is framed and the case is tried by the designated court an appeal against conviction sentence or acquittal lies only to the supreme court and to no other court. under section 12 of tada the designated court has the jurisdiction not only to try the cases under tada but also to try offences under the indian penal code if the offence under tada is connected with such other offences. the amplitude of powers available to this court under article 142 of the constitution of india is normally speaking not conditioned by any statutory provision but it cannot be lost sight of that this court exercises jurisdiction under article 142 of the constitution with a view to do justice between the parties but not in disregard of the relevant statutory provisions. the transfer of the appeal to the high court after hearing the appeal on merits and finding that section 3 of tada on the basis of the evidence led by the prosecution was not made out is neither desirable nor proper nor permissible let alone justified. there cannot be piece meal hearing of an appeal on merits  first by this court to determine if an offence under tada is made out or not and then by the high court.

[Facts] leave granted. interpretation of the provisions of s 46 1  b  of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958  hereinafter called and referred to for the sake of brevity as  the said act   is involved herein. the factual matrix of the matter which is not much in dispute is as under. first respondent is the registered proprietor of a trade mark  field marshal  for diesel engines since 1964 bearing no 228867 one m s. jain industries got the trade mark  field marshal  registered under clause  7  inter alia for flour mills centrifugal pumps couplings for machines pulleys included in class 7 and valves  parts of machines  the said registration was renewed for the periods 13 5 1972 and 12 5 1979  13 5 1979 and 12 7 1986 and 13 7 1986 and 12 7 1993 appellant is said to have commenced its business of manufacturing and selling centrifugal pumps also under the mark  field marshall. allegedly on the premise that the first respondent is the proprietor of the said mark by reason of long user and thus acquired a reputation in that behalf a legal notice was issued upon it questioning its right to use the said mark in respect of centrifugal pumps by the appellant laying a claim that it had been using the said mark since 1963. respondent no 1 thereafter filed a suit in the delhi high court for grant of a decree of permanent injunction being suit no 2408 of 1985 alleging infringement of the said mark and or claiming right of passing off in respect thereof. an ex parte order of injunction was passed on 19 12 1985 against the defendant  appellant herein  to the following effect. notice for april 8 1986 meanwhile a temporary ex parte injunction is issued against the defendants restraining them from manufacturing or selling either themselves or through any dealer or representative diesel oil engines or parts thereof with the trade mark  field marshal  and or any other trade mark identical therewith and all goods falling in cl 7 of the trade and merchandise mark rules. the plaintiff shall comply with the requirements of order 39 rule 4 of the code of civil procedure. indisputably during the proceedings in the above suit m s. jain industries by a deed of assignment assigned the said trade mark along with its goodwill in favour of the appellant. one of the stipulations contained therein reads as under    that the party of the second part has satisfied the party of the first part of having used the mark field marshal in respect of centrifugal pumps and valves since 1973. indisputably first respondent filed an application under section 46 56 and 107 of the act marked as c o no 9 of 1986 contending that m s. jain industries having not used the trade mark in respect of centrifugal pumps for a period more than five years and one month the mark should be taken off the register. it claimed user of the said mark since 1963 and sought for rectification of the register by expunging the expression  circulation and centrifugal pumps  from the specification of goods. indisputably appellant filed an application in form tm 24 on 17 6 1986 the assistant registrar trade marks passed an order on 10 11 1986 certifying    that the trade mark field marshal brand  word per se  is registered under no 228867 in part  a  of the register as of the date 13th. may 1965 in class 7 in respect of flour mills circulating and centrifugal pumps  coupling for machines  pulleys included in class 7 and valves  parts of machines  in the name of pooran chand jain and kailash chand jain trading as jain industries 1166 phatak. suraj bhan belanganj agra. that pursuant to a request on form tm 23 dated 17th june 1986 and order thereon dated 24th october 1986. ganga ram anil kumar  huf  sunil kumar and sumitra rani trading as thukral mechanical works railway road sirhind  punjab  are registered as subsequent proprietors of this mark as from 30th may 1986 by virtue of agreement dated 30th may 1986 and. that. the registration of the aforesaid trade mark has been renewed from time to time and will remain in force for a period of a seven years from 13th. may 1986 and may be renewed at the expiration of that period and of each succeeding period of a seven years. in the said c o no 9 of 1986 filed by the first respondent against m s. jain industries despite service of notice nobody appeared on behalf of the defendant 16 1 1987 was the date fixed in the said suit. the learned judge directed recording of statements of the learned counsel in this behalf  pursuant whereto the same were recorded which reads as under    c o 9 of 1986. mr. singh has filed a reply in this petition bringing out that presently he is the registered owner of the trademark which is sought to be cancelled in this petition. in view of this situation learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that he may be permitted to withdraw this petition with permission to file a fresh petition on this very cause of action after impleading m s thakural mechanical works etc. let the statement of learned counsel for the petitioner be recorded. statement of shri k l aggarwal counsel for petitioner without oath. in view of the submissions of m s thakural mechanical works i may be permitted to withdraw this petition with permission to file a fresh petition on this very cause of action. statement of shri hemant singh counsel for m s. thakural mechanical works without oath. i have no objection if the petitioner is permitted to withdraw this petition with permission to file a fresh petition on this very cause of action. on the basis of the said statement the following order was passed    this petition has been filed by m s. pm diesels pvt ltd. against m s. jain industries and the dy. registrar of trade marks under section 46 56 and 107 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958 for rectification of entry relating to the registered trade mark no 228867 in class 7 after. the notice was served upon the respondent 1 a reply has been filed by m s thakural mechanical works bringing out there in that they are now the registered proprietors of said. trade mark no 228867 in. this view of the matter learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that he may be permitted to withdraw this petition with permission to file a fresh petition on this very cause of action. the request is not opposed on behalf of m s thakural mechanical works. in these circumstances the request of the plaintiff is granted and petitioner is permitted to withdraw this petition and file a fresh petition on this very cause of action. the petition is accordingly filed as withdrawn leaving the parties to bear their own costs. a fresh application was filed by the first respondent. the said m s. jain industries however was not impleaded as a party therein. the cause of action therefor was stated to have arisen in the following circumstances    that the cause of action for the present petition arose in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents in the month of january 1987 when the respondent informed this hon ble court that they have been recorded as subsequent proprietors of the impugned registered trade mark no 228867 in class 7 in c o no 9 of 1986 whereupon the petitioner withdrew the said earlier petition c o no 9 of 1986 with permission of the court to file the present petition because of the changed circumstances. the cause of action is continuous from day to day till the impugned registration is cancelled rectified. the injunction matter in suit no 2408 of 1985 came up for hearing before a learned single judge of the high court. by an order dated 19 1 1988 having regard to the provisions contained in the said act the learned judge opined that appellant having become the registered proprietor of the said trade mark no case for grant of injunction has been made out the interim order of injunction passed on 19 12 1985 was vacated and the defendants were permitted to use their registered trade mark subject to the following conditions     a  defendants will not use the logo style of the word  field marshal  of which logo and style the plaintiff is the proprietor under the copyright act. b  defendants shall mention the name of the defendant firm thukral mechanical works sirhind on each and every centrifugal pump manufactured by them and sold in the name of  field marshal. c. the defendants shall maintain proper accounts of the sale of centrifugal pumps under the trade mark  field marshal  and shall file them in court as and when directed. the second rectification application filed by the first respondent however was transferred to the intellectual property appellate board. the said application was dismissed. a writ petition was filed there against by the first respondent. a learned single judge of the delhi high court however refused to stay the operation of the order of the board dated 27 10 2004 an appeal was preferred there against. the division bench of the high court thereafter while disposing of both the writ petition and the letters patent appeal allowed the writ petition and set aside the order of the board and directed it to adjudicate the dispute on merits. the said order of the division bench is under challenge in this appeal. for the purpose of appreciation of the rival contentions we may notice the findings of the board as also the high court. the board has taken the view that the period of five years and one month will begin to run from the date on which thukral became the proprietor of the trademark that is 30th may 1986 and therefore the rectification application could have been filed by the appellant only sometime in 1991 opining that an application for rectification against the appellant within a period of seven and a half months from the date of assignment of the trade mark was not maintainable the application was dismissed. the high court on the other hand opined   it was not anybody s case before us that m s jain industries. the registered proprietor of the trademark used it at all. the trademark was used by the appellant and thukral neither of whom were proprietors thereof except that thukral claims to have become its proprietor with effect from 30th may 1986 according to learned counsel for the appellant the use of the trademark by thukral was not legally permissible use inasmuch as thukral did not have the consent tacit or otherwise of m s. jain industries to use the trademark. if thukral did then it cannot be said that there was no bona fide use thereof by its proprietor. that is m s jain industries. this appears to be the position at least till 30th may 1986 in. the meantime as a result of the ex parte ad interim injunction granted on 19th december 1985 by this court in suit no 2408 of 1985 there was no question of thukral using the trademark field marshal till the injunction was vacated on 19th january 1988.
[Ratio of the decision] correctness or otherwise of the said order has not been questioned. the core question which arises for our consideration is as to whether in the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case the application under s 46 1  b  was maintainable. indisputably the scope of the provisions for removal from register in terms of s 46 and 56 of the act stand on different footings. whereas s 46 had a limited application s 56 of the act is wider in nature. concededly cl  a  of sub s  1  of s 46 is not attracted in the case. the act was enacted to provide for the registration and better protection of trademarks and for the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks of merchandise. registration of a trade mark remains valid for seven years. renewal applications are required to be filed on the expiry of seven years. m s. jain industries got itself registered and obtained periodical renewal thereof as is required under the act. first respondent withdrew the application against m s. jain industries. the prayer in the application was to take off the registered trade mark from the register in respect of centrifugal pumps  goods  so far as the registration made in favour of the appellant is concerned. it is in the aforementioned situation we are called upon to determine the meaning of the words  for the time being  occurring in s 46 1  b  of the act. two interpretations thereto which are possible are   1  the said words would denote non use of the trade mark in relation to the goods by the appellant for a period of five years or longer  and  2  the mark had not been used for a period of five years or longer either by the present proprietor thereof or his predecessor. we may however also notice that another construction of the said provision has been put forth by mr. sunderam learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the word  proprietor  would not mean a registered proprietor but also a person who has become  proprietor  by long use thereof. the words  for the time being  would mean differently in different situations. the terms also may bring within its umbrage the entire period of five years or more irrespective of the fact as to whether the registered proprietor was one or more than one as has been held by the high court. there cannot be any doubt or dispute that the registration of a trade mark confers a very valuable right. the person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner. it confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered. the same is an assignable right in terms of s 36 of the act whereas an unregistered trade mark is not. non. user of the said mark therefore entails the consequences laid down under cl  b  of sub s  1  of s 46. however such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved. when the applicant before the board establishes the fact in regard to non user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub s  3  of s 46. the question which therefore arises is as to who can prove that he had the bona fide intention to use the trade mark on the date of application for registration. indisputably it would be the registered proprietor. s 46 is a penal provision. it provides for civil or evil consequences. it takes away the valuable right of a registered proprietor. it therefore can be taken away only when the conditions laid down therefor are satisfied. while we say so we are not oblivious of the fact that trafficking in trade mark is to be discouraged. a registered proprietor of a trade mark should not be permitted to circumvent the law of user of the trade mark for a long time by assigning the same from time to time. but then such a case has to be made out. allegation of trafficking is a serious one. it must be proved in presence of the person against whom such allegations are made. at the time of grant of original registration advertisements are issued and objections are called for. renewal of registration in a sense also is not automatic. a person who had been using the said trade mark as a proprietor thereof by user is supposed to keep itself abreast with such applications filed by another either for registration of the trade mark or renewal thereof. the non user for a long time would disentitle a registered proprietor from renewal of the registration. it must not however be forgotten that s 46 1  b  provides for a special remedy. as a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration and or renewal thereof he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage. if the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non user on the part of his predecessor. in other words the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non use of the present registered owner. it must however be observed that whether a use is for bona fide purpose would essentially be a question of fact. whether s 46 1  b  read with s 48 of the act would bring within its purview not only a registered proprietor but also the proprietor who had otherwise acquired a right would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. the submission of mr. sudhir chandra. that the appellant was an infringer both of the right of m s. jain industries as also the first respondent and thus its use was not bona fide in a case of this nature cannot be accepted. if appellant infringed the right of m s. jain industries it was for it to take action there for. it did not. first respondent itself accepts that at least immediately prior to the institution of the suit appellant had been using the same. we are not concerned herein as to since when it had been doing so. it obtained an or of injunction. the order of injunction was vacated. for one reason or the other the said order attained finality. prima facie therefore appellant has been held to be the registered owner of the trade mark. it is one thing to say that for the purpose of frustrating an application for rectification the appellant had colluded with its predecessor for the purpose of trafficking by entering into the deed of assignment which is otherwise illegal and bad in law. but it is another thing to say that the appellant could be proceeded against alone for non user of the registered trade mark for a period of more than five years. for the purpose of making out such a case both the original registrants as also the assignee were required to be impleaded as parties. we may at this stage notice that in law of trade marks by mr. k c kailasam while commenting on s 47 of the trade marks act 1999 to which our attention has been drawn by mr. sudhir chandra it is stated. notes on clauses. this clause corresponds to s 46 of the existing act and provides for removal of a trade mark from the register on the ground of non use. a trade mark which is not used within five years of its registration becomes liable for removal either completely or in respect of those goods or services for which the mark has not been used. under s 46 1  it is proposed to clarify that the five years period will start from the date on which the trade mark is actually entered on the register. this amendment is intended to remove any ambiguity as for all other purposes the date of registration will be the date on which the application was filed vide cl 23 2  proviso to sub cl  1  also provides that the tribunal may refuse removal of the mark if it is shown that any proprietor had in fact made bona fide use of the trademark for goods or services of the same description or associated goods or services. it is also proposed to increase the period from 1 to 3 months in cl 47 1  a  and  b  in which use of the trade mark prior to the date of filing of the application for removal of the trade mark shall be disregarded. this is intended to prevent the registered proprietor to by pass the act by such token use after he comes to know that an application for removal is about to be filed  sub cl  3  protects a mark from being removed from the register on ground of non use if such non use is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade. the clause is proposed to be modified to clarify that special circumstances in the trade will include restrictions imposed by any law or regulation on the use of trade mark in india. consequential amendments have been made to cover services  cl 47 of the bill. the court while construing a statute takes into consideration the parliamentary intent in amending the provisions thereof. it seeks to enhance the period of moratorium of use of the registered trade mark from one month to three months so as to prevent speculative assignment. thus a case of speculative assignment is specifically required to be made out. such an application may be maintainable in terms of s 56 of the act but strictly not in terms of s 46 1  b  thereof and that too in the absence of the original registered proprietor. we are not satisfied with the explanation offered by the first respondent that it gave up the case of non use of the registered trade mark against m s jain industries on the basis of statement made by the learned counsel for the appellant  firstly because consent does not confer jurisdiction  secondly because want and or lack of jurisdiction on the part of the tribunal cannot be waived as if any order is passed without jurisdiction the same would be a nullity  and thirdly because the cause of action even according to the first respondent in his application before the high court was different. the counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant did not state that it had waived its right so far as non impleadment of m s. jain industries was concerned. it only consented for grant of liberty in favour of the first respondent for filing of an application for the self same cause of action. the question of maintainability of the second suit is absence of the registrant proprietor was not and could not have been the subject matter of consent at that stage. the cause of action which permitted the first respondent to file an application for rectification against m s. jain industries was non user thereof by it. its non user and rectification of the register could not in the aforementioned situation have been tagged with the cause of action if any against the appellant. the second contention of mr. that the appellant was an infringer of the trade mark is again a question of fact. the right of the first respondent as a proprietor of the trade mark by reason of a long user is required to be determined vis   vis m s. jain industries as also the appellant in the suit filed by it which is pending. the board could not while exercising its jurisdiction under s 46 1  b  of the act proceeded on the basis of such presumption. it is not correct that no cause of action survived against jain industries. it was not lost by reason of assignment as was contended by the learned counsel. in the suit only the competing right of the first respondent qua the appellant can be determined and not a right against m s. such a right cannot be determined in a proceeding under s 46 1  b  of the act which is restricted to non user of the registered trade mark. both the appellant and the respondent no 1 were the infringers of the right of m s. jain industries as it was the registered proprietor of the trade mark in respect of the goods in question namely centrifugal pumps. two interpretations of the said provision s 46 1  b  are possible. while interpreting the same however certain basic principles of construction of statute must be kept in mind. as it takes away somebody s right it deserves strict construction. jurisdiction of the board being dependent on determination of the foundational facts the same was required to be established on the basis of the averments made in the application and not otherwise. the right of a registered trade mark is not lost automatically on the expiry of five years and one month. it does not provide for a  sun set  law. it has to be adjudicated upon. whether the registered proprietor of the trade mark had taken recourse to trafficking or not must be determined in an appropriate proceeding. the principle of  purchaser of a property has a duty to make enquiries  therefore cannot apply in a case of this nature. so long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid once the same is validly assigned the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute. a title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the act cannot be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished. both the findings of the high court which we have noticed hereinbefore are findings on question of law and in that view of the matter the contention of mr. sudhir chandra that the merit of the matter is yet to be gone into by the board cannot be a ground for ignoring the submissions made at the bar. our attention has again been drawn to a passage from  law of trade marks   geographical indications  by shri k c kailasam wherein the judgment of the tribunal has been criticized in the following terms    from the above legislative intent it would seem that the period of non use of the trade mark is to be reckoned continuously from the date of its registration. in the case of american home products corporation v. mac laboratories pvt ltd. rendered under the 1958 act it was held by the supreme court that  the person seeking to have the trade mark removed from the register has only to prove. such continuous non user   it would appear that neither the u k act nor the indian act at any time envisaged that the commencement of 5 year period of non use is to be delinked from the date of registration of the mark so as to give a fresh lease of life to the registration every time there is change in the ownership of the mark. if that be so any registered proprietor could easily defeat an application for rectification by assigning the mark to some other person to have a fresh period of 5 years from the date of assignment and thus effectively frustrate the very object of the provision in s 47 1  a  and  b  further it is to be noted that an assignment is subject to  the provisions of the act and any rights vested in any other person   see. s 37 the assignor cannot obviously transfer more rights than he himself has to the assignee under the act. we do not think that the approach of the learned author is entirely correct. an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses. if his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non user of the trade mark for a period of five years any assignment made shall be valid subject to such situation which we have noticed in paragraph 25 supra.

[Facts] the state of manipur is in appeal before us questioning the judgment and order dated 29 07 2005 passed by a division bench of the guwahati high court in wa nos 61 78 79 95 and 100 of 1999 upholding a judgment and order of a learned single judge of the said court dated 19 02 1999 in c r nos 324 1012 568 1022 and 1023 of 1998. one shri a j tayeng was the revenue commissioner of government of manipur. the state of manipur had not framed any recruitment rules for appointment inter alia in the revenue department and in particular the field staff thereof. the commissioner of revenue department was conferred with a power of being the cadre controlling authority for non ministerial post of the revenue department. he was also to be the chairman of the departmental promotion committee for non ministerial post of the revenue department. the commissioner allegedly made certain appointments in the posts of mandols process servers and zilladars which was not within the knowledge of the state. the said appointments were made on temporary basis. appointments were made on 11 09 1997 22 11 1997 and 5 12 1997 a sample copy of the offer of appointment reads as under   no 1 14 97 com  rev   on the recommendation of d p c and under the directives issued by the hon ble gauhati high court the following persons are hereby appointed as mandols on temporary basis in the scale of pay of rs 950 20 1150 eb 25 1400  per month with usual allowances against thereto existing clear vacancies of mandals under revenue department from the date of their joining on duties. 2 further they are posted at the places indicate against their names   3 the expenditure is debitable under appropriate heads of accounts of the departments  offices concerned. no record in regard to the said recruitments was maintained. an inquiry was therefore made to find out the authority which had issued the said offers of appointments. shri tayeng by a uo note dated 12 01 1998 denied to have made such an appointment stating   confidential u o no 2 15 93 com  r  pt. imphal the 12th jan  1998 sub  submission of report. with reference to the u o letter no 2 15 93 com r. pt. dated 6th january 1998 regarding the alleged appointment of ad hoc  regular appointment to the post of lambus  mandols. etc of. the hon ble minister  revenue  i am to say that i am not all aware of such appointments made by me except for 3 lambus who were kept in panel for appointment and accordingly the s o  revenue. shri robert shaiza was instructed to take care. i therefore deny making of such appointments. on the other hand md. a r khan secretary  revenue  has made many appointments of mandols  process servers  zilladars in the recent months against which i have been complaining that the secretary  revenue  has no power or authority to make any appointments of field staff as per rules provided under m l r act 1960 in this regard i have apprised the matter to the hon ble minister  revenue  already and also informed the chief secretary manipur explaining that the secretary  revenue  cannot make such appointments of field staffs even if he wanted to do so all the relevant files should have been routed through the undersigned so that the same may be brought to the notice of the hon ble minister  revenue  his action has created lots of misunderstanding and confusion. he has been making false and wrong allegations against the commissioner  revenue  and putting him false position. it is for this reason i have been writing to all the deputy commissioners in the districts even by sending w t messages clarifying the actual position of making any appointment of revenue field staff. i still deny that i have made any appointment of field staffs of revenue department during the recent months. submitted for information and consideration. sd  12 1 98  annayok j tayeng. commissioner  revenue. govt of manipur minister  revenue. in view of the aforementioned stand taken by the said shri tayeng the offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents were cancelled by an order dated 17 02 1998 a corrigendum thereto was however issued on 21 02 1998 stating   no 2 15 93 com rev. temp i  please read as  august 97  in place of  october 97  occurring in the 4th line of this government order no 2 15 93 com rev. temp i dated 17 2 1998. in civil appeal arising out of slp  c  no 19375 19376 of 2005 the respondents were appointed on ad hoc basis for a period of six months. their appointments were also cancelled on similar grounds. the said shri tayeng retired on 28 02 1998 despite the fact that he in his uo note dated 12 02 1998 addressed to the minister of revenue denied to have made any appointment when approached by the writ petitioners respondents he affirmed in their support an affidavit in the high court stating   3 that while i was functioning as revenue commissioner manipur matters relating to appointment on the recommendation of the d p c  transfer etc were put up to me in files and i used to pass order on the basis of facts presented to me in file. i also issued appointment order under my signature. after my retirement from service i have no access to such files. as stated above i was transferred and posted to the manipur electronics development corporation during 1997. 4 that after my retirement some of the writ petitioners civil rule no 568 of 1998 came to me and show copy of the writ petition and the counter affidavit of the respondent no 1 2 and 3 i have gone through the copy of the writ petition and the counter affidavit and annexures thereto. the xerox copy of the cyclostyled appointment order bearing no 1 14 97. com  rev   dated 11 9 97  annexure a 1 to the writ petition  appointing 3 persons to the post of mandol and no 1 14 97 com  rev. dated 11 9 97  annexure a 2 to the writ petition  appointing 4 persons to the post of mandol are perused by me minutely. i submit that these appointment orders  annexures a 1 and a 2  bear my signature  initial  and appear to have been issued under my signature. it appears that the appointment orders were issued after complying the formalities prescribed there for which can be ascertained from the relevant official file. since i have retired from service i have no access to the file and do not know what might have been in the file and where is the file. verified that the above statements are true to the best of my knowledge and no part of it is false. the writ appeals preferred there against by the appellants herein were dismissed.
[Ratio of the decision] the respondents herein filed writ petitions before the high court on 4 06 1998 questioning the said order of cancellation of their appointments. the state while offering appointments having regard to the constitutional scheme adumbrated in arts 14 and 16 of the constitution of india must comply with its constitutional duty subject to just and proper exceptions to give an opportunity of being considered for appointment to all persons eligible there for. the posts of field staffs of the revenue department of the state of manipur were thus required to be filled up having regard to the said constitutional scheme. we would proceed on the assumption that the state had not framed any recruitment rules in terms of the proviso appended to art 309 of the constitution of india but the same by itself would not clothe the commissioner of revenue to make recruitments in violation of the provisions contained in arts 14 and 16 of the constitution of india. the offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents herein were cancelled inter alia on the premise that the same had been done without the knowledge of the revenue department of the state. no records there for were available with the state. as noticed hereinbefore an inquiry had been made wherein the said shri tayeng the then commissioner of revenue stated that no such appointment had been made to his knowledge. the state proceeded on the said basis. the offers of appointment were cancelled not on the ground that some irregularities had been committed in the process of recruitment but on the ground that they had been non est in the eye of law. the purported appointment letters were fake ones. they were not issued by any authority competent therefor. if the offers of appointments issued in favour of the respondents herein were forged documents the state could not have been compelled to pay salaries to them from the state exchequer. any action which had not been taken by an authority competent therefor and in complete violation of the constitutional and legal framework would not be binding on the state. in any event having regard to the fact that the said authority himself had denied to have issued a letter there was no reason for the state not to act pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof. the action of the state did not thus lack bonafide. moreover it was for the respondents who had filed the writ petitions to prove existence of legal right in their favour. they had inter alia prayed for issuance of a writ of or in the nature of mandamus. it was thus for them to establish existence of a legal right in their favour and a corresponding legal duty in the respondents to continue to be employed. with a view to establish their legal rights to enable the high court to issue a writ of mandamus the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in arts 14 and 16 of the constitution of india. they have not been able to show that any advertisement had been issued inviting applications from eligible candidates to fill up the said posts. it has also not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment exchange. the commissioner furthermore was not the appointing authority. he was only a cadre controlling authority. he was merely put a chairman of the dpc for non ministerial post of the revenue department. the term  dpc  would ordinarily mean the departmental promotion committee. the respondents had not been validly appointed and in that view of the matter the question of their case being considered for promotion and  or recruitment by the dpc did not and could not arise. even assuming that dpc would mean selection committee there is noting on record to show who were its members and how and at whose instance it was constituted. the commissioner as noticed hereinbefore was the chairman of the dpc how the matter was referred to the dpc has not been disclosed. even the affidavit affirmed by shri tayeng before the high court in this behalf is silent. the appointing authority in absence of any delegation of power having been made in that behalf was the state government. the government order dated 12 01 1998 did not delegate the power of appointment to the commissioner. he therefore was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters. the respondents therefore in our opinion were not entitled to hold the posts. in a case of this nature where the facts are admitted the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with particularly when the same would result in futility. it is true that where appointments had been made by a competent authority or at least some steps have been taken in that behalf the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in view of the decision of this court in murugayya udayar 1991 indlaw sc 904  supra. we as noticed hereinbefore do not know as to under what circumstances the orders of appointments were issued. the said decision is not an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in all situations. we in the facts and circumstances of this case do not see any arbitrariness on the part of the state in its action directing cancellation of appointments.

[Facts] appellant before us was detained u s 3 of the conservation of foreign exchange and prevention of smuggling activities. act 1974. for short  cofeposa. he is the managing director of a company registered and incorporated under the provisions of the companies act known as m s. sundesh springs private limited. it was an exporter and held a valid licence therefor. the company was to export products of alloy steel. upon exporting of alloy steel it was entitled to credits under the duty entitlement pass book  depb. scheme introduced by the government of india with an object of encouraging exports. he allegedly misdeclared both the value and description of goods upon procuring fake and false bills through one prabhjot singh. the said prabhjot singh was said to have been operating three firms viz. m s. s p industrial corporation m s. aaysons  india  and m s. p j sales corporation ludhiana. it was allegedly found that non alloy steel bars rods etc of value ranging from rs 15  to rs 17  per kg were exported in the guise of alloy steel forgings bars rods etc by declaring their value thereof from rs 110  to rs 150  per kg and the export proceeds over and above the actual price were being routed through hawala channel. the officers of the directorate of revenue intelligence  dri  searched the factory as well as the residential premises of appellant and that of prabhjot singh. various incriminating documents were recovered. appellant and the said prabhjot singh made statements u s 108 of the customs act. prabhjot singh allegedly admitted to have supplied fake bills to units owned and controlled by appellant on commission basis without actual supply of the goods. it was also found that appellant had declared goods exported as  alloy steel  whereas after the tests conducted by central revenue control laboratory they were found to be  other than alloy steel  i e  non alloy. the consul  economic  consulate general of india at dubai allegedly confirmed the existence of a parallel set of export invoices. invoices with a higher value were presented before the indian customs authorities with a view to avail depb incentives but in fact invoices with a lower value were presented for clearance. on the aforementioned allegations an order of detention was issued on 5 4 2005 appellant moved for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus before the high court of judicature of punjab and haryana. the said writ petition was dismissed by an order dated 23 11 2005 by a learned single judge. a letters patent appeal concededly which was not maintainable was filed thereagainst which was dismissed by reason of the impugned judgment. on 13 10 2003 appellant was arrested. he was discharged on bail on 6 1 2004 several inquiries were conducted both inside and outside india. a report in relation to overseas inquiry was received on 12 5 2004 on 25 6 2004 proposal of detention was sent which was approved on 2 12 2004 on. 20 12 2004 the authorities of the dri stated that transactions after 11 10 2003 were not under scrutiny. furthermore the authorities of the dri by a letter dated 28 02 2005 requested the bank to defreeze the bank accounts of appellants. the order of detention was passed on 5 4 2005. so far as the question of non placement of material documents before the detaining authority is concerned we may notice the following dates   i. by a letter dated 5 7 2002 the authorities of dri stated that appellant stood exonerated for earlier years after detailed examination. ii. by a letter dated 20 12 2004 the authorities of dri stated that transactions after 11 10 2003 were not under scrutiny and by letters dated 28 2 2005 and 7 3 2005 the bank accounts of appellant were defreezed. iii. by reason of the civil court by orders dated 7 5 2004 and 31 5 2004 the bank accounts of m s. girnar and shri amar were defreezed. iv. by an order dated 13 8 2004 the tribunal ordered release of goods. v  by orders dated 31 8 2004 and 28 10 2004 the civil judge directed release of documents to appellant. vi. by an order dated 18 11 2004 the civil court issued contempt notice to the authorities of dri for non release of documents and the authorities of dri made a statement before the court that the documents are being returned. in paragraph 36 of the order of detention the detaining authority stated   in view of the facts mentioned above i have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that you have through your acts of omission and commission indulged in prejudicial activities as narrated above. considering the nature and gravity of the offence the well planned manner in which you have engaged yourself in such prejudicial activities and your role therein as brought out above all of which reflect your high potentiality and propensity to indulge in such prejudicial activities in future i am satisfied that there is a need to prevent you from indulging in such prejudicial activities in future by detention under cofeposa act 1974 with a view to preventing you from smuggling goods in future. what is therefore relevant was as to whether the documents were material. if the documents were material so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his constitutional as also statutory right non supply thereof would vitiate the order of detention.
[Ratio of the decision] before us several other grounds viz  non placement of vital  material documents before the detaining authority non supply of documents relied on or referred to in the order of detention as also non application of mind on the part of the detaining authority had been raised. in the meantime admittedly the period of detention being over appellant had been set at large. he was released from custody on 17 5 2006. we may first deal with the question of unexplained delay. in this regard we may notice the following dates. indisputably delay to some extent stands explained. but we fail to understand as to why despite the fact that the proposal for detention was made on 2 12 2004 the order of detention was passed after four months. we must also notice that in the meantime on 20 12 2004 the authorities of the dri had clearly stated that transactions after 11 10 2003 were not under the scrutiny stating   in our letter mentioned above your office was requested not to issue the depb scripts to m s. girnar impex limited and m s. siri amar exports only in respect of the pending application if any filed by these parties up to the date of action i e 11 10 2003 as the past exports were under scrutiny being doubtful as per the intelligence received in this office. this office never intended to stop the export incentives occurring to the parties after the date of action i e 11 10 2003 in the civil your office letter. no b l  2 misc. am 2003 ldh dated 17 05 2004 is being referred which is not received in this office. you are therefore requested to supply photocopy of the said letter to the bearer of this letter as this letter is required for filing reply to the hon ble court. furthermore as noticed hereinbefore the authorities of the dri by a letter dated 28 02 2005 requested the bank to defreeze the bank accounts of appellant. the said documents in our opinion were material. it was therefore difficult to appreciate why order of detention could not be passed on the basis of the materials gathered by them. it is no doubt true that if the delay is sufficiently explained the same would not be a ground for quashing an order of detention under cofeposa but as in this case a major part of delay remains unexplained. delay as is well known at both stages has to be explained. the court is required to consider the question having regard to the overall picture. in the instant case we have noticed hereinbefore that the authorities of dri themselves categorically stated that the activities of appellant after 11 10 2003 were not in question and in fact all the bank accounts were defreezed. although learned additional solicitor general may be correct in his submissions that ordinarily we should not exercise our discretionary jurisdiction u art 136 of the constitution of india by allowing appellant to raise new grounds but in our opinion we may have to do so as an order of detention may have to be considered from a different angle. it may be true that the period of detention is over. it may further be true that appellant had remained in detention for the entire period but it is one thing to say that the writ of habeas corpus in this circumstances cannot issue but it is another thing to say that an order of detention is required to be quashed so as to enable the detainee to avoid his civil liabilities under safema as also protect his own reputation. in a case of this nature we do not think in view of the admitted facts that we would not permit appellant to raise the said questions. we have noticed hereinbefore that learned additional solicitor general contended that appellant obstructed the proceedings by initiating various civil litigations. but indisputably those documents involving the civil court proceedings were not placed before the detaining authority. if the same had not been done not only the delay in issuing the order of detention stood unexplained but also thereby the order itself would become vitiated. furthermore the civil court proceedings were over on 19 11 2004. evidently the detaining authority did not take immediate steps to detain appellant. why the documents pertaining to the proceedings of the civil court had not been placed before the detaining authority has not been explained. on their own showing respondents admit that they were relevant documents. we have been taken through the order of detention. the statements of appellant and the said prabhjot singh were recorded therein in extenso. recording of such statement must have been made from the xeroxed copies of such documents which were available with the detaining authority. the self inculpatory statements of appellant as also prabhjot singh purported to have been made in terms of s 108 of the customs act were required to be considered before the order of detention could be passed. the same was not done. the original of such documents might not been available with the detaining authority but admittedly the xeroxed copies were. it has not been denied or disputed that even the xeroxed copies of the said documents had not been supplied to the detenue. it may be true that appellant in his representation dated 14 06 2005 requested for showing him the original documents referred to or mentioned in the grounds of detention but then at least the xeroxed copies thereof should have been made available to him. union of india and another. it is a trite law that all documents which are not material are not necessary to be supplied. what is necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents but thus all relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his fundamental right u art 22 5  of the constitution of india. right to make an effective representation is also a statutory right  see sunila jain v. 2006  3 scc 321 2006 indlaw sc 65. in this case the statements of appellant and prabhjot singh in our opinion were material. they could not have been withheld. if original of the said documents were not available xeroxed copies thereof could have been made available to him. the detaining authority moreover while relying on the said documents in one part of the order of detention could not have stated in another part that he was not relying thereupon. the very fact that he had referred to the said statements in ex tenso is itself a pointer to the fact that he had relied upon the said documents. even in the earlier part of the impugned order of detention i e detaining authority appears to have drawn his own conclusions.

[Facts] this appeal  by special leave  has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 23 february 2005 of bombay high court  aurangabad bench   by which the appeal preferred by the appellants was dismissed and their conviction under section 304 b read with section 34 ipc and sentence of 7 years ri imposed thereunder by the learned sessions judge  aurangabad  was affirmed. the deceased bhimabai was daughter of pw 1 tukaram eknath tambe resident of village sanjkheda. and she was married to appellant no  1. appasaheb son of sheshrao palaskar about two and half years prior to the date of incident which took place on 15 september 1991. the appellant no  2  kadubai is the mother of the appellant no  1 and both the appellants were residing in the same house in village palshi. according to the case of prosecution  a sum of rs. 5000 and some gold ornaments had been given at the time of marriage of bhimabai. for about six months bhimabai was treated well but thereafter the accused started asking her to bring rs. 1 000 1 200 from her parents to meet the household expenses and also for purchasing manure. whenever bhimabai went to her parental home  she used to tell her parents that her husband and mother in law  accused appellants  were harassing her and used to occasionally beat her. her father pw 1 tukaram along with some of his relatives went to the house of the accused and tried to persuade them not to ill treat bhimabai. thereafter  the accused treated bhimabai properly but after about four months they again started harassing her. a few days before nag panchami festival bhimabai came to her parental home and complained that the accused were not giving her proper food  clothing and even footwear. she also told her parents that her husband had asked her to bring an amount of rs 1 000 1 200 for the purpose of household expenses and manure. the case of the prosecution futher is that in the evening of 15 september 1991 a person came from village palshi on a motorcycle and informed pw 1 tukaram that bhimabai was unwell. pw 1 then immediately went to the house of the accused along with some of his relatives. there he saw that bhimabai was lying dead and froth was coming out of her mouth which indicated that she had consumed some poisonous substance. the police patil of the village pw 3 sandu mohanrao patil lodged an accidental death report at 9 00 p m  on 15 september 1991 at the police station. on the basis of the said accidental death report  pw 6 sandeepan kamble  police sub inspector  visited the house of the accused  held inquest on the dead body of bhimabai  and thereafter sent the same for post mortem examination. pw 1 tukaram lodged the fir of the incident at 7 00 p m  on 16 september 1991 at p s  chikalthana  on the basis of which case crime no  144 of 1991 was registered against the appellants under sections 498 a  306 and 304 b ipc. after completion of investigation  charge sheet was submitted against the appellants and in due course  the case was committed to the court of sessions. the learned sessions judge framed charges under sections 498 a  304 b read with section 34 ipc and section 306 read with section 34 ipc against both the appellants. the appellants pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. the prosecution in order to establish its case examined six wintesses and filed some documentary evidence. we have heard learned counsel for the appellants  learned counsel for the state of maharashtra and have perused the records. the post mortem examination on the body of deceased bhimabai was conducted by a team of two doctors of department of forensic medicine and toxicology  medical college  aurangabad  namely  dr  s m  jawale and dr  h v  godbole on 16 september 1991. the doctors did not find any sign of external or internal injury on the body of the deceased and in their opinion  the cause of death was insecticide poisoning. the viscera were preserved for chemical analysis. the report of the post mortem examination was admitted by the defence. the specific case of the prosecution is that bhimabai ended her life by consuming poison because of harassment caused to her by the appellants for or in connection with demand of dowry. it is  therefore  necessary to briefly examine the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. pw. 1 tukaram  father of the deceased  has given details of the prosecution version of the incident in his statement in court. he has deposed that in the marriage he had given rs  20 000 as dowry. initially  bhimabai was treated well for about six months  but thereafter the appellants started ill treating her. whenever bhimabai came to her parental home  she used to complain that for some domestic reasons she was being harassed. when she had visited her parental home on the last occasion  she had said that her husband appasaheb had asked her to bring rs. 1 000 1 200 for domestic expenses and for purchasing manure as he had no sufficient money. bhimabai had complained to him that she was not being given proper food  clothings and even footwear and occasionally the appellant no  1 used to beat her. the last time she visited her parental home was during the festival of nag panchami and at that time she looked depressed. the witness has further deposed that on the date of incident  a man came from village palshi on motorcycle and informed that he should immediately go there as bhimabai was not well. he then went to village palshi along with other persons of his family where he reached after sun set. he saw that bhimabai was lying dead and froth was coming out of her mouth which was smelling of thimet  insecticide. in his cross  examination he has admitted that his statement that he had given rs 20 000 in dowry at the time of marriage was incorrect and in fact he had given rs. 5 000 as dowry and the total expenses incurred in the marriage was about rs. 20 000. he has also deposed that it was after about 1 1 2 years of marriage that bhimabai first complained to him about the harassment being caused to her. there used to be some bickering in the marital life of bhimabai and her husband on trifling matters. he has admitted that it was appellant no. 1 who had sent a person on motorcycle who had given information regarding bhimabai being unwell and that both the appellants were present at the time of her funeral. pw 2 babaji is real brother of father in law of pw 1 tukaram. he has deposed that on an earlier occasion he had gone along with pw 1 and some others to the house of appellant no 1 to persuade him not to harass bhimabai and to treat her well. in his cross  examination he has admitted that when he had gone to village palshi to talk with the appellants regarding the ill treatment being meted out to bhimabai  there was no talk regarding monetary giving and taking. he also admitted that he had not gone to attend that funeral of bhimabai. pw 5 sumanbai is the mother of the deceased bhimabai. she has stated in her examination in chief that bhimabai was being ill treated by the appellants and the reason for ill treatment was that they were demanding money to be brought from her parental home. the last time bhimabai visited her parental home was on the occasion of the festival of nag panchami and she had complained that she was being ill treated and was sometimes given beating for bringing money from her parents. she has specifically stated that for a period of six months after the marriage  bhimabai was treated well and thereafter she had started complaining about the harassment being caused to her. in her cross examination  pw 5 sumanbai has stated that after news about the condition of bhimabai was given by a man from village palshi  she along with her husband and some other relations went there and noticed that bhimabai was lying dead in the house and froth was coming out of her mouth. she has further stated that she did not make any enquiry as to how bhimabai had died. in her statement under section 161 cr. p c  which was recorded very next day of the incident i e  on 16 september 1991 she did not state that cause of ill treatment was  a demand for money and a consequent beating. when confronted with her aforesaid statement under section 161 cr. she replied that she did not know why there was no mention in the said statement that the cause for ill treatment was  a demand for money and a consequent beating. she further stated that it will be correct to say that her daughter was receiving ill treatment as a result of  domestic cause. the learned trial judge then sought clarification from the witnesses by putting the following question. que. what do you mean by  domestic cause. ans. what i meant was that there was demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc. and that was the cause. in the very next paragraph she stated as under     it is not true to suggest that in my statement before the police i never said that ill treatment was as a result of demand for money from us and its fulfillment. i cannot assign any reason why police did not write about it in my statement. 3 sandu  police patil of village palshi has deposed that at about 4 20 p m  on 15 september 1991  narayan who is uncle of appellant no 1  appasaheb  informed him that the wife of appasaheb had expired. he then went to the house of the appellant and saw bhimabai lying with froth coming out of her mouth. thereafter  he gave a report about the incident in writing at the police station. in his cross examination  he admitted that he did not make detailed enquiries as to what was the cause of death and where the incident had taken place. he has further deposed that bhimabai had come to his house about six months earlier and had said all was not well between her and her husband  but she had not given any specific details.
[Ratio of the decision] p c. the main witnesses regarding the alleged demand of money and also harassment and beating to bhimabai are her father and mother  viz. pw 1 tukaram and pw 5 sumanbai. in his examination in chief pw 1 has said that whenever his daughter came to her parental home  she used to complain that she was being subjected to harassment by the appellants on account of some  domestic reasons  and further that her husband  appellant no 1  had told her that while coming back from her parental home she should bring rs. 1 000 1 200 for expenses and for manure as he had no sufficient money. pw 5 sumanbai has deposed that bhimabai was receiving ill treatment as a result of  domestic cause  and to a specific question put by the court as to what she meant by  domestic cause  she gave a reply that there was a demand for money for defraying expenses of manure etc. it is important to note that in her statement under section 161 cr. p c  which was recorded on the very next day of the death of bhimabai  this witness did not state that the cause for ill treatment was  a demand for money and a consequent beating. the evidence on record does not indicate that the police had any reason to favour the accused and deliberately omitted to mention about the alleged demand of money while recording the statement of pw 5 sumanbai under section 161 cr. the evidence shows that the accused come from very humble background and they could not have exerted any kind of influence  financial or otherwise  upon the police so as to manage a statement favourable to them when in the course of investigation the statements of witnesses were being recorded under section 161 cr. accepting the statements of father and mother on their face value that utmost which can be held is that the appellant no 1 had asked his wife bhimabai to bring money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure. in view of the aforesaid definition of the word  dowry  any property or valuable security should be given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties. therefore  the giving or taking of property or valuable security must have some connection with the marriage of the parties and a correlation between the giving or taking of property or valuable security with the marriage of the parties is essential. being a penal provision it has to be strictly construed. dowry is a fairly well known social custom or practice in india. it is well settled principle of interpretation of statute that if the act is passed with reference to a particular trade  business or transaction and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade  business or transaction knows or understands to have a particular meaning in it  then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning. see union of india v  garware nylons ltd   air  1996. sc 3509 1996 indlaw sc 2404 and chemicals and fibres of india v  union of india  air  1997. sc 558 1991 indlaw sc 861. a demand for money on account of some financial stringency or for meeting some urgent domestic expenses of for purchasing manure cannot be termed as a demand for dowry as the said word is normally understood. the evidence adduced by the prosecution does not  therefore  show that any demand for  dowry  as defined in section 2 of the dowry prohibition act was made by the appellants as what was allegedly asked for was some money for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing manure. since an essential ingredient of section 304 b ipc viz. demand for dowry is not established  the conviction of the appellants cannot be sustained. we do not consider it necessary to examine this question. as already stated  the appellants were also charged under sections 498 a and 306 read with section 34 ipc but were acquitted of the said charges by the learned sessions judge  which order has attained finality for the reason that the state did not prefer appeal against the same. the appeal before the high court and also in this court has been preferred by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304 b read with section 34 ipc. therefore  we have refrained from expressing any opinion as to whether the appellants could be held guilty of having committed the offence under section 498 a or 306 ipc on the basis of evidence available on record as their acquittal under the aforesaid charges has attained finality and cannot be reversed in the appeal filed by the appellants challenging their conviction under section 304 b ipc.

[Facts] the present appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 01 07 2002 passed by the high court of bombay at goa in criminal appeal no  6 of 2000 convicting the accused appellant u s. 302 of the indian penal code  for short the  the ipc   and sentencing him to undergo life imprisonment for the offence by setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the trial court. on 19 04 1988 between 8 30 p m  and 8 45 p m   satish narayan sawant  the appellant  accused no  1  along with two other accused persons and also with two delinquent children allegedly formed an unlawful assembly and that in furtherance of the said common object stabbed one rauji dulba sawant  the deceased and also assaulted baby dulba sawant  pw 1   ashok dulba sawant  pw 2   kunda rauji sawant  pw 8  and laxmi dulba sawant  pw 18  who are the sister  brother  wife and mother respectively of the deceased. it is also the case of the prosecution that as a result of the aforesaid stab injuries given to the deceased  he expired on the same day i e  on 19 04 1988. p s  joaquim dias  pw 21  who was attached to the ponda police station as p s i  received a phone call at about 10 45 p m  from p s i  k k  desai of the panaji police station that a person named rauji dulba sawant had been brought in police jeep by police constable jaisingrao rane and that while he was being taken to the goa medical college  he expired. he was informed that the deceased had died as a result of stab injuries received and  therefore  he was to take necessary steps. on receipt of the aforesaid message  pw 21 along with asi tabit mamlekar went to the scene of offence. they reached the scene of offence at about 11 30 p m  but found the entire place plunged into darkness and with the help of torch light  pw 21 surveyed the scene of offence. during the survey made at the place of occurrence  pw 21 noticed some blood stains in the front courtyard of the house and a pipe of length of about 1 foot or slightly less lying in the courtyard having blood stains. thereafter  pw 21  along with p i  d sa gave a call to the inmates of the house to open the door and on hearing the call  one lady opened the door. on enquiring from her  pw  21 learnt that her name was  yeshoda  who was later on arrayed as accused no  3. two juvenile girls named  sarita and sharmila  who are the sisters of the appellant were found in the house. in the meantime  pw 1  pw 2 and pw 8 came to the house from whom pw 21 made certain inquiries and brought them along with accused no  3 and her two juvenile girls to the police station. not finding the appellant and accused no 2 in the house  dy. s p  shri raikar and p i. shri alan o sa were sent in their search. after reaching the police station  a complaint  which is marked as exhibit pw 1 a was lodged by pw 1  in which it was alleged that pw 1  pw 8  pw 18  the deceased rauji and his brother narayan were residing in one house in banastari and they used to share a common kitchen between them. it was further alleged by pw 1 that two or three days before the ganesh festival  deceased rauji had informed narayan that he would install statue of lord ganesh in the house and accordingly  he had purchased the same. religious ceremony was performed by installing the statue of lord ganesh in the house and. while the said religious ceremony was being performed  accused no  2 started uttering insults while standing in the kitchen. accused no  3 told the appellant not to do anything in the ceremony and insulted the family members of rauji. pw 1 also alleged that on 19 04 1988 the deceased rauji returned from his duty at about 6 30 p m  and thereafter went to purchase some articles. on his return  he went to take bath and after having bath  he went and switched off the light of the room. as soon as the deceased switched off the light  the appellant came from the room and started abusing rauji. there was a heated exchange of words between rauji and the appellant switched on the light  which was again switched off by rauji  the deceased. thereupon  the appellant went and removed the fuse of the said light. accused no  3 had then lit a kerosene lamp and brought the same in the hall. there was already an oil lamp burning which was attached to the ceiling by a brass chain. meanwhile  accused no  3 started abusing pw 1  pw 8  pw 18  and the deceased rauji. thereafter  the appellant and the two other alleged accused namely  accused nos. 2 and 3 and the two juvenile offenders gathered in the hall to assault rauji  the deceased  pw 1 and pw 8. according to pw 1  in order to avoid the assault by all of them  they went to  bulcao   balcony. when they went there  the appellant went to his mother s room and brought a knife with which he stabbed rauji. at that time all the accused persons were in the balcony. it was also alleged that after the deceased rauji fell down on the ground  accused no  3 kicked him. at that time  the appellant who was holding the knife in his hand  handed over the same to accused no  3 by which she assaulted pw 8 but pw 8 caught the knife in her hand which caused injury to her right palm. thereafter  according to pw 1  accused no  3 handed back the knife to the appellant and accused no  2 brought the oil lamp which was hung in the room and hit the oil lamp on the head of rauji  the deceased. it was also alleged that when pw 8 tried to intervene  the other three accused started assaulting her with fists and slaps. at that time  pw 2 came there and questioned the accused persons as to what they were doing  whereupon  the appellant and accused no  2 started assaulting pw 2 also. then  accused no  3 told the appellant and accused no  2 to finish off rauji first  pw 8  pw 18 and pw 1 then lifted rauji and brought him in the courtyard. in the meanwhile  residents of the locality had gathered in the courtyard and told the accused persons not to assault rauji. the juvenile offender  sarita went inside the house and brought out one iron pipe which she handed over to the appellant who then hit the said pipe on the right leg of pw 1 and also gave a blow with the said pipe on rauji s right hand. it was also alleged that the other juvenile offender  sharmila brought a cement block shaped like an elephant trunk  which she handed over to accused no  3 with which accused no  3 started assaulting rauji  pw 1  however  intervened and removed the said piece of cement block from the hand of accused no  3 but. accused no  3 then picked up one stone and tried to throw it on rauji by saying that she was going to kill him with that stone. however  pw 1 again intervened and removed the said stone from the hand of accused no 3. pw  18 rushed to the rescue of deceased rauji. the accused then started assaulting her and pw 8 with slaps. in the meantime  police jeep arrived at the scene and on seeing the police jeep  all the accused ran away from the courtyard and went inside. pw   1 and others asked the police to take rauji to the hospital. whereupon the police took him to the hospital in the police jeep along with pw 1  pw   2 and pw  8. on the basis of complaint made by pw 1  an fir was registered and the accused came to be arrested. on completion of the investigation  the police submitted the charge  sheet against the accused persons namely the present appellant  accused no  1   accused nos. 2 and 3 and the two juvenile offenders  namely sarita and sharmila. the trial court framed charges against all the accused persons for the offence under sections 302  323  143  147 and 149 of the ipc. the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. since there were two juvenile offenders there cases were segregated and the trial against accused nos. 1  2 and 3 was conducted during the course of which a number of eye witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution. after completion of the arguments the trial court reserved the verdict. the trial court passed an order on 04 08 1998 acquitting all the accused persons from the offences under sections 302  323  143  147 and 149 of ipc. being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order of acquittal the state filed an appeal in the high court against accused nos. 1 to 3. the appellant herein  being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of conviction and sentence  filed the present appeal on which we have heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and also the learned counsel appearing for the state.
[Ratio of the decision] facts giving rise to the present appeal may be stated first so as to enable us to appreciate the arguments raised by the parties more effectively. 302 ipc. in the light of the aforesaid submissions of the counsel appearing for the parties we have given our in depth consideration to the facts of the present case. the starting point of the incident in question as indicated from the evidence on record is the hall where apparently a dispute started between the parties with regard to the electricity connection in the house. the deceased tried to put off the light of one particular room at which the appellant and other accused persons became annoyed and the appellant switched on the light which was again switched off by the deceased. at this  the deceased became annoyed and the appellant removed the fuse of the electricity which act of his plunged the entire house into darkness. it is also clear and established that thereafter a lamp was brought by accused no  3 to the room besides another lamp which was already burning in the said room itself. but  in any case  there was an electricity light post in the front of the house which was giving enough light to the house. there is also evidence on record to show that even outsiders were watching the incident from the road which indicates that there was sufficient light for them to see what was happening in the house where the incident had taken place. there was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which accused no  1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant. the said fact is proved by the evidence of pws. 2  8  18 and the complainant herself  pw 1. the deceased was taken to the hospital and while so taken he died. pw 21 who was at that time attached to konda police station as psi was informed at about 10 45 p m  that the deceased while was being brought in the police jeep by a police constable jaisingrao rane and was being taken to the government medical college but before the deceased could be admitted he died. pw 21 was also informed by said by said psi k k  desai of panaji police station that it was a case of assault and that the incident had taken place at verandah and that the said matter pertains to his police station and  therefore  he should take appropriate action. on receiving the said message he went to the place of occurrence along with psi k k  desai and upon reaching the place of occurrence at 11 30 p m  he found the entire place plunged in total darkness. therefore  he proceeded to survey the place of occurrence with the help of torches. he  in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house. he stated that although the house had electricity connection  but was not having the electricity supply. he gave instructions to his subordinate and also to the people around that nobody should touch any article lying at the scene of occurrence. he stated that he made preliminary enquiry and brought yashoda and her two daughters to the police station and sent two other officers in search of accused nos. 1 and 2 who were not found in the house. he also stated that he got the complaint registered at the police station which was lodged by pw 1 and that on the next day he again went to the scene of offence and seized the properties involved in the crime which were sealed. he also recovered the knife at the instance of accused sharmila which he seized. on 28 04 1988  that is  after about 9 days of the incident  accused nos. 1 and 2 surrendered before the police and on their surrender they were taken into custody. it was found that accused no  1 was having injury on his back. and he was medically examined. on medical examination his injury was found to be simple. in the instant case  it is quite clear from the evidence on record that pw 1 received the information about the death of the deceased from psi of panaji police station without any detail as to how the incident had happened and who had caused the incident. it was a very cryptic information received by him regarding the death of a person residing within the jurisdiction of his police station pursuant to an incident taking place on 10 04 1988 between 8 30 p m  to 8 45 p m  and  therefore  it appears that there was not enough information available to him either to get a g d  entry recorded or to get an fir lodged. in order to verify the information received  pw 21 went to the place of occurrence and found the entire house in total darkness. he went around the house and saw blood marks on the walls of the verandah and also in the courtyard and came to learn about the incident by using torch light. when he reached at the place of occurrence even the complainant party was not available there. but at a later stage they came there. therefore  he brought them along with the residents of the house who were found to be there namely accused no  3 and the two juvenile offenders namely sarita and sharmila  who were all ladies. after reaching the police station and at the request of pw 1 the fir was recorded at 3 00 a m  in the morning. he received the information about the incident on telephone at about 10 45 p m  and reached the place of occurrence at about 11 30 p m  and he must have been there for quite some time and thereafter returned to the police station which must have taken another about 1 30 to 2 hours. therefore  recording of the fir at about 3 00 a m  in the morning was justified and properly explained and it cannot be said that there was any delay in recording the fir. besides  the fact of his going to the place of occurrence would not amount to making an investigation. there is no evidence to show that at that point of time  pw 21 seized any articles or interrogated any witnesses or took any other action in initiating or in furtherance of investigation. the ratio of the decision in bhagwant kishore joshi 1963 indlaw sc 268  supra  is applicable to the facts of the present case as the police officer merely visited the spot and place of occurrence and made some survey which cannot be regarded as investigation. the ratio of the aforesaid decision is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case. even assuming that pw 21  the investigating officer could have entered the aforesaid information received from psi of panaji police station in the general diary  yet they said entry could not have been held or treated to be an fir. the information received by him was very cryptic and without any detail about the incident in question and  therefore  in any case  there was no possibility of recording an fir at that stage. the place of occurrence was in total darkness and even the persons belonging to the complainant side were not available  therefore  bringing them to the police station where there was sufficient light and recording the complaint at 3 00 a m  cannot  in any manner  cast any doubt on the veracity of the prosecution case. in that view of the matter it cannot be said that the fir was in any manner hit by the provisions of s  162 of crpc. so far contention that there was violation of s  157 of the crpc is concerned  the same is also without any basis for the defence never cross examined pw 21 on the aforesaid issue. so long the defence is not able to establish from the records by cogent evidence that there was any delay in sending the fir to the magistrate  it cannot be held that there was any such delay. there is no evidence on record before us to hold either way for no such issue was raised either before the trial court or before the high court nor any evidence was led by the defence in respect of the said issue which is sought to be raised at this stage. from the evidence on record it does not appear to us that any suggestion was given to the said witness to the effect that the copy of the fir was not sent or that it was dispatched late  which if given  would have given an opportunity to the witness to afford some explanation or to show as to when the fir  was sent to and received by the magistrate. in that view of the matter we do not agree with the counsel appearing for the appellant that delay in transmitting the fir to the magistrate stands proved in the present case. the next contention that we proceed to discuss now is about whether sufficient light was available at the place of occurrence for the eye  witnesses to see the occurrence as stated by them in the evidence. we have pws. 1  2  8 and 18 as eye witnesses to the occurrence. these eye witnesses have stated that the incident had happened initially in the hall where there was some light for accused no  3 has brought a lamp to the hall and apart from that another lamp was also burning which was attached to the ceiling. blood was found by the police on the wall of the verandah and in the courtyard. it is also established from the evidence on record for it is clearly stated that the street light having tube light was giving sufficient light to the place of occurrence and that it was directed towards the house which was the place of occurrence. besides  all the aforesaid eye witnesses were inmates of the house and they would know as to who had given the blows for they specifically stated that initially the appellant did not have the knife in his hand but when the deceased and others went to the balcony then he went inside the house and brought a knife with which he gave stab injuries to the deceased which became fatal and as a result of which the deceased died while he was being taken to the hospital. the aforesaid eye witnesses  although  are related witnesses  were natural witnesses for they were the inmates of the house where the incident had taken place. the said eye witnesses are consistent about the principal act of the appellant in stabbing the deceased. the discrepancies which were sought to be pointed out are minor discrepancies without in any manner affecting the substratum of the prosecution case and therefore  minor discrepancies in the evidence of the eye witnesses are immaterial. the aforesaid eye witnesses were cross examined at length but even after such lengthy cross examination these eye witnesses account could not be shaken. the postmortem report indicates that there were sixteen injuries as against the two as adduced in ocular evidence and  therefore  a submission was made by the counsel appearing for the appellant that the medical evidence adduced in the present case is not supporting the ocular evidence. however  a perusal of record clearly shows that the doctor who conducted the postmortem  pw 7  stated in his evidence that there were in total 16 injuries when external examination was done by him and the knife m  o  11 could have caused the injuries no  1  2  3 and 4. he further stated that the death was caused due to hemorrhage and shock as a result of stab injury. he further stated that injury no  1 was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. on being cross examined  pw 7 categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of injury no  1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature. there is no doubt that four injuries are indicated in the postmortem report shown to have been received by the deceased but the fact that the deceased was given stab injuries by the appellant with the help of a knife brought by him from inside the house is clearly established from the ocular evidence. there is therefore one particular injury  being injury no  1 caused because of stabbing and the rest being superficial in nature could be caused during scuffle. therefore  the alleged discrepancy cannot be said to be very vital as it has been held by this court in several decisions that ocular evidence cannot be brushed aside only because  to some extent  it is not in consonance with the medical evidence. reference in this regard may be made to the decision of this court in state of u  p  v  krishna gopal   1988  4 scc 302  1988 indlaw sc 76 anwar v  state of haryana   1997  9 scc 766  1997 indlaw sc 2447 ravi kumar v  state of punjab   2005  9 scc 315 2005 indlaw sc 170  munivel v  state of t n    2006  9 scc 394 2006 indlaw sc 118. all the contentions raised by learned counsel appearing for the appellant were considered by us in the light of evidence on record. and we find that none of the aforesaid submissions has any basis. there is cogent and reliable evidence on record to prove and establish that the accused has committed the act of stabbing as a result of which the deceased had died. before dwelling further into the factual matrix of the case on the basis of which the high court convicted the appellant u s. 302 ipc  it would be useful to briefly recapitulate the law on the point. that being the well settled legal position  when we test the factual background of the present case on the principles laid down by this court in the aforesaid decisions  we are unable to agree with the views taken by the high court. as already noted  it is quite clear from the record that there was an altercation preceding the incident. the place of occurrence is a residence inhabited by both the parties and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was armed with any weapon. initially the accused appellant also did not have any weapon with him but during the course of the incident he went inside and got a knife with the help of which he stabbed the deceased. pw 7. in his cross examination has categorically stated that death due to stab injury was in consequence of injury no  1 and all other injuries were superficial in nature. so  it was only injury no  1 which was fatal in nature. factually therefore  there was only one main injury caused due to stabbing and that also was given on the back side of the deceased and therefore  it cannot be said that there was any intention to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness. records clearly establish that there was indeed a scuffle between the parties with regard to the availability of electricity in a particular room and during the course of scuffle the appellant also received an injury which was simple in nature and that there was heated exchange of words and scuffle between the parties before the actual incident of stabbing took place. there is  therefore  provocation and the incident happened at the spur of the moment. that being the factual position  we are of the considered view that the present case cannot be said to be a case u s. but it is a case falling under s  304 part ii ipc. it is trite law that s  304 part ii comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.

[Facts] a suit was filed in s c suit no 493 of 1986 in the bombay city civil court bombay by vicco laboratories appellant herein manufacturers of ayurvedic pharmaceutical products against defendant nos 1 to 4 respondents herein for a declaration that the title and format of the suit serial  yeh jo hai zindagi  exclusively belonged to them and respondents nos 1 to 4 have no right thereto and for permanent injunction restraining the said respondents from making use of the title or episodes belonging to the petitioners or any episodes hereafter made. a number of averments germane to this case as set out in the plaint are set out hereunder. the petitioners carried on business as manufacturers of ayurvedic pharmaceuticals products which were sold under the brand name of  vicco  and have acquired substantial reputation in the market. the 1st respondent are an advertising agency and have been the advertising agents in respect of the products manufactured by the petitioners as aforesaid for number of years. the 2nd respondent is a director and or partner of the 1st respondent and has mainly dealt with the petitioners on behalf of the 1st respondent. respondents nos 3   4 are proprietary concerns of respondent no 2 the 5th respondent is the union of india and has been joined as the authority concerning television in india in the name and style of doordarshan which is a television media. the petitioners had employed the respondent nos 1 to 4 as their advertising agents through the petitioners  sister concern  m s modern advertising agency  and  uta advertising agency  and were dealing with the respondent no 1 mainly through the petitioners managing director g k pendharkar. in 1984 doordarshan in order to popularize sponsored serial undertook the production of a serial by the name  humlog  the petitioners are also pioneers in making use of doordarshan for advertising their products through the agency of the 1st respondent approached the 1st respondent to act as their agents for the purpose of producing a serial which would be shown as petitioners  sponsored programme. the petitioners agreed to pay the entire costs of the said production to the said advertising agency and requested it to look into the matter employed various persons on behalf of the petitioners and prepare a suitable serial for them. pursuant to the said arrangement the respondent nos 1 to 4 as the agents of the petitioners prepared at the costs and expenses of the petitioners a serial entitled  yeh jo hai zindagi  the petitioners claimed that as a result of the employment of the respondent nos 1 to 4 and the finances paid by them the petitioners are the owners of the said serial  yeh jo hai zindagi  and the title thereof. the first and second respondents under the arrangement produced about 60 episodes and the petitioners have spent a crore of rupees for the products and telecast of the said episodes and have also spent large sums of money on advertising to popularize the said programme  yeh jo hai zindagi  had gained popularity and had become one of the most exclusive and popular serial. the petitioners claimed that the exclusive right to use the title thereof belonged to them and the 2nd episode of  yeh jo hai zindagi  was telecast without the name of the petitioners being mentioned as sponsors nor was their advertisement shown. this was due to the negligence of the respondent nos 1 to 4 but the respondents recovered the cost of production from the petitioners. further the said respondents had been recovering the cost of production well in advance of the serial episodes being actually produced. the petitioners claimed that they were the real producers and owners of the said serial  yeh jo hai zindagi  and the petitioners to the knowledge of the respondents have entered into an agreement assigning the video rights in the said serial to one m s esquire distributing and servicing pvt. ltd on. 01 january 1985 the petitioners though not required to do so made an ex gratia payment to respondent nos 1 to 4 of a portion of the royalty received by them from the said m s esquire distributing and servicing pvt ltd. 1st and 2nd respondents had by their letter dated 14 december 1984 confirmed that the petitioners have all t v and video rights of the sponsored programme in hindi  yeh jo hai zindagi  and vest with the petitioners. though original agreement was to have 27 episodes but having regard to the popularity of the programme the petitioners decided to increase the said serial to 52 episodes and by a letter dated 22 april 1985 the petitioners informed respondent nos 1 and 2 that in the title of the 27th and 28th episodes it has been stated that it is presented by  oberoi films  some time in may 1985 the 1st respondent proposed to the petitioners that some other products should be tied up with the serial  yeh jo hai zindagi  however the petitioners were not interested in the same as they wanted the serial to project their products only exclusively and did not agree to any other products being tied up with the said serial. the respondents on 27 december 1985 alleged that they were losing rs 50 000  to rs 75 000  per episode and indicated that they wanted to get a new sponsor. by their letter dated 02 january 1986 the petitioners informed the 1st and 2nd respondents that it was not possible to increase the costs of production for the episodes and that in the circumstances the production of the serial may stop. it was also pointed out that the name  yeh jo hai zindagi  is associated with the  vicco laboratories  and that if they wanted to obtain another sponsor they could produce a new serial under a different name. the petitioners apprehended that the respondent nos 1 to 3 intended to produce further episodes under the title  yeh jo hai zindagi  making use of the same format as the earlier serial for and on behalf of the third party. the petitioners reserved their right to sue for damages in terms of order ii rule 2 cpc. the respondent nos 1 to 4 in their written statement contested the suit. apart from raising the question of valuation of the suit and the pecuniary jurisdiction of the court to try the same they also raised question that the petitioners are not the owners of the copyright in the said serial within the meaning of s 17 of the copyright act 1957 and the copyright in respect of the said serial belongs and vests with the respondent nos 1 to 4. these ad films and jingles fetched handsome returns for the petitioners and boosted their sales beyond their own expectations. in course of time the 2nd respondent and partners of the petitioners especially g k pendharkar came very close to each other and developed very intimate relations. either at the end of 1983 or early part of 1984 the 5th respondent through the said doorsarshan decided to introduce the production of films or serials especially for exhibitions on tv instead of exhibiting telecasting films produced by the professional film producers on payment of exorbitant royalty to them partly as an economy measure and partly to provide avenues to and exposure new talents. the 5th respondent thereafter decided to entertain welcome and or encourage the proposals from the private producers to produce such serials or films at their own cost and responsibility and under the said scheme the advertisers desirous of linking up their advertisements with such films or serials were required to negotiate and settle directly with the producers of such films and or serials the royalty or consideration payable to such producers for linking up their advertisements and commercials with their film serial and under the said scheme further such advertisements were offered handsome concessions in the rates of advertisements for display of their ads on tv. as against the regular rates charge of rs 3 24 000  for display of advertisements on tv of such advertisers for 120 seconds per telecast the relevant time at the rate of rs 35 000  only for 120 seconds in addition to the royalty or consideration payable to the producers of such films or serials which invariably was far less than the difference between the usual rates and concession rates of advertisements. the 2nd respondent undertook the preliminary project work on his own without loss of any time. the 2nd respondent made extensive study and research and prepared a format of the proposed serial. the said team of the 2nd respondent responded to his appeal and took great pains and put in hard work in the said project and presented to him an exclusive and ingenious format of the proposed serial. the 2nd respondent then approached the 5th respondent through doordarshan with his proposal to produce the said serial then proposed to be entitled  mussibat hai  after a number of meetings between the 2nd respondent and the concerned officers and the authorities of the respondents at delhi in connection with the said proposal approved a pilot  i e the first episode as sample  on 19 september 1984 to produce a tv serial comprising 52 episodes subject of course to the 5th respondent discretion to discontinue the same if the same proved a flop before the expiry of the stipulated period. the entire cost of the spade work and the cost of the title song was borne exclusively by the respondents and nothing was contributed by the petitioners in this regard. the 5th respondent registered the respondent nos 1 and 2 as the producers of the said serial. after finalizing the proposal by the tv authorities respondent no 2 asked the petitioners as to whether they were interested in the linking up their ads with the said serial. petitioners agreed to link up their ads with 26 episodes of the said serial. the petitioners agreed to pay fixed amount to these respondents per episode for linking up their commercials with the said serial and not on the basis of the actual cost of production of each episode so that if the cost of production exceeded the said fixed amount the respondents had to bear the same. in these circumstances the respondents contended that by entering into the said agreement of sponsorship neither the petitioners nor the respondents created nor did they ever intend to create any relationship of employer and employee and or master and servant or principal and agent between the petitioners on the one hand and the respondents no 1 to 4 on the other. nor did the parties intend that the respondents should produce the said serial for the petitioners or at the instance of the petitioners and the respondents intended to embark on the production of the said serial on their own. the trial court raised as many as 12 issues and they are as follows   1  is it proved that this court has no pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain and try this suit. 2 do. the plaintiffs prove that the t v serial entitled  yeh jo hai zindagi  was produced by the defendant nos 1 to 4 as agents and  the said serial made by defendant nos 1 to 4  in the course of their employment with the plaintiffs as alleged. 3 do the plaintiffs prove that the entire serial rights including the excluding the exclusive right to use the title thereof belong to the plaintiffs as alleged. 4 are defendant nos 1 to 4 entitled to deny the ownership of the plaintiffs of the

zindagi   within the meaning of s 17 of the copyright act. 6 do. the defendant nos 1 to 4 prove that it was intended between the parties that copyrights in respect of the said film should vest exclusively with the defendants or that the right of ownership was waived by the plaintiffs. 7 does. the suit suffer from non joinder of necessary parties. 8 is. the suit not maintainable against defendant no 5 for failure to give notice u s 80 of cpc. 9 are. the plaintiffs entitled to the declaration sought. 10 are. the plaintiffs entitled to permanent injuction as prayed for. 11 to what relief if any are the plaintiffs entitled. 12 what order. the trial court found that the petitioners have not been able to prove that the tv serial  yeh jo hai zindagi  was produced by defendants nos 1 to 4 as agents in the course of their employment as the agent of the petitioners as contended in the suit. the petitioners were also not able to prove that the entire serial rights including the exclusive right to use the title thereof belonged to the petitioners as alleged. it was also held that the respondents nos 1 to 4 are entitled to deny the ownership of the petitioners of the film  yeh jo hai zindagi in view of exhibits a b and e produced in the case. it was also held that the respondents proved that the petitioners are not the owners of the copy right of the tv serial film viz   yeh jo hai zindagi  within the meaning of s 17 of the copy right act and it was intended between the parties that copy rights in respect of the said film should vest exclusively with the respondents or that the rights of ownership was waived by the petitioners. after examining the oral and documentary evidence on record it is disclosed that prior to letter sent on 11 july 1984 the petitioners were acquainted even with the format of the suit serial they did not have any connection with the suit serial till that date and relied upon the wording used therein to the effect that  you and mr. g k pendharkar are requested to join mr. oberoi and his creative team when the format of the proposed half and hour sponsored programme shall be presented to you. that was the first occasion when the format was presented to the petitioners. it was also on record that the shri g k pendharkar of the petitioners and respondent no 2 had long standing relations with each other and they had already done a lot of advertising works for the petitioners before the production of the suit serial. exhibit g 1  which is exhibit 27 a in the petitioners  compilation  is a letter written by shri s p agrawal controller of programmes of doordarshan to respondent no 1 m s art commercia with reference to the format for the proposed serial of half and hour duration tentatively titled  musibat hai  serial sent to them on 13 july 1984 since the letter was addressed to m s art commercia in which the proposal was accepted for production of the serial and the first episode was to be sent for preview and approval which would be given only after seeing the recording of the first episode. that letter had been addressed to respondent no 1 m s art commercia. the trial court felt that it was addressed not to the petitioners but to the respondents alone. the trial court also relied on exhibit c 1 which indicated that the respondents were submitting a format for the serial which was to be registered on behalf of the client m s vicco laboratories. the learned judge of the trial court took the view that this letter nowhere mentioned that the respondents wanted to register their format on behalf of their producers which is consistent with the modern norms of advertising. the trial court ultimately came to the conclusion that the spade work on the production of the suit serial had already started before 11 july 1984 and on that day for the first time film was presented to the petitioners. the trial court after examining exhibits c 1 e 1 f 1 p 1 found that the proposal was for 52 episodes and was accepted by the doordarshan while the case put forth on behalf of the appellants is that the original agreement was to have 27 episodes and having regard to the popularity of the programme the petitioners decided to increase the said serial to 52 episodes. the evidence was found to be inconsistent with the theory put forth by the petitioners that they are producers of the suit serial and if it were to hold otherwise the agreement or arrangement with the respondents was only for 26 episodes whereas the sponsorship was for 52 episodes. the trial court examined in detail the letter dated 19 july 1984  exhibit f 1  written by shri g k pendharkar of the petitioners and concluded that averments made in the plaint stated that the original agreement was to have 27 episodes but having regard to the popularity of the serial programme the petitioners decided to increase the said serial to 52 episodes. in one of the contracts  exhibit h 1  the wording used is as under     sponsorship of programme of 25 mts duration produced by sponsor entitled  yeh jo hai zindagi  including 2 mts free commercial time. relying upon this letter emphasis was laid on the words  produced by sponsors   whether two capacities  sponsor  and  producer  can co exist in one and the same person or not has been examined and the trial court noted that the wording had been borrowed from the tariff card and tariff card also indicated what are the categories of the advertisers and rates thereof. it is held that words  produced by sponsors  would not mean that the sponsors themselves are the producers of the said programmes as is clear from the tariff card. the trial court proceeded thereafter to examine the payments made in regard to production of the serial. thus it was found that the first 26 episodes the amount per episode paid by the petitioners was rs 1 20 000  and each bill contained the expression  service charges  which was stated by the appellants that the respondents acted as agents of the petitioners for production of suit serial. on proper construction of the bills the trial court rejected the contention that these bills and payments as showing that they had borne the costs of production of the suit serial and therefore they are the producers. inasmuch as the respondents could not claim any amount at random details regarding expenditure were included in the bills and therefore it is the sponsor s price for sponsoring the suit serial. strong reliance was placed upon certain circumstances namely that the format had been approved by the petitioners only on 11 july 1984 and pw 1 admitted that in view of the bill the entry claiming deduction made by the petitioners in their accounts in the financial year ending on 30 march 1984  that the amount was not to be paid for all 26 episodes or even thereafter in lump sum and the bill for 26 episodes enabled petitioners to claim deduction for the entire amount without actual payment in financial year 1983 84  that the entry made for the financial year 1983 84 was beneficial to the petitioners that there was no ceiling on advertising expenditure and it was introduced from 1 april 1984 onwards the plaintiff did not produce the account books to show if the deduction in respect of the entire amount was claimed or not though they were repeatedly called upon to produce them. the trial court was conscious enough not to enter into the controversy whether during the particular account year ending on 31 march 1984 the advertising expenditure was fully exempted from tax or that there was disallowance of 20 per cent on that point and the decision regarding income tax deductions is not necessary as there is enough other material to show that the said bill was ante date. the change in the title from 55th episode  for vicco laboratories  was introduced. their contention was that there was a protest from the petitioners and as a result thereof this change took place. the 55th episode was telecast sometime at the end of november or beginning of december 1985 and thus there was a time gap of 7 8 months between the protest and the telecast of the 55th episode. the trial court also noticed that in respect of both the advertisements and also in respect of suit serial the petitioners paid to the respondent nos 5 and 6 amount which was to be the maximum amount. thus the profits or loss was of the respondents and there is element of liability to render account was missing and thus there was no question of respondents being the agents of the petitioners within the meaning of s 182 of the indian contract act. the suit serial was produced by the respondents as agents of the petitioners was false. the facts emerging in the case indicate that the petitioners had joined the production of the suit serial after some concrete beginning had been made like recording of the title song the conceiving of the title and format of the suit serial etc. the trial court summed up the position that the two capacities  sponsor  and  producer  cannot co exist in one and the same person. if the documents are interpreted that the petitioners are the sponsors as well as the producers it would lead to absurd results. thus the trial court proceeded to uphold the contentions raised on behalf of the respondents to dismiss the suit. on appeal the high court re examined the matter and on examination of the pleadings the contentions put forth before the court the evidence on record and the findings recorded by the trial court concluded that the findings recorded by the trial court are proper. in doing so the high court noticed that the admitted position in the pleadings and the oral evidence is that the petitioners agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes whereas the respondents had agreed to produce 52 episodes and had made firm commitment to doordarshan to that effect and this circumstance militates against the respondents having undertaken the production at the behest or at the request of the petitioners. the high court also noticed the circumstance of respondent no 2 s name appearing as  producer  in the titles of the suit serial and the petitioners did not do anything by way of protest or other objection or take steps to withhold payment of the respondents which in the normal course would have been done and therefore the explanation now sought to be offered by the petitioners in the form of a written protest was devoid of any substance. the explanation given by the petitioners that they were busy in the shootings did not carry much weight with the high court. the high court also examined the scope of s 17 of the copyright act and the ingredients thereof not having been established the high court held that no claim could be based on the same and thus agreed with the findings recorded by the trial court and dismissed the appeal.
[Ratio of the decision] it was therefore found that there was no copy right attached to any idea but copy right is attached to the work and what is important is that not only the idea of producing the suit serial on tv came to the mind of respondent no 2 but he had already started working on it in advance and forwarded it to doordarshan for its approval. therefore it cannot be said that there is any communication between the same. in this special leave petition u art 136 of the constitution the contentions raised before the high court are reiterated particularly as to the effect of s 17 of the copyright act and whether the correspondence on record would not indicate that they were entitled to ownership and copyright in respect of the tv programme  yeh jo hai zindagi. we have carefully considered the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioners. we are not satisfied that the petitioners have made out a case for consideration by this court. the matter rests purely upon the appreciation of evidence on record and does not give rise to any question of such importance as to be decided by this court u art 136 of the constitution. it is clear from the findings recorded by the trial court and the appellate court   1 that the respondents have not undertaken the production of the said serial at the instance of the petitioners. g k pendharkar the managing director of petitioner no 1 was asked to come to view the format of the programme and the petitioners were not even acquainted with the format of the serial while the respondents had taken concrete steps in this regard prior to the letter dated 11 july 1984. 2 that the petitioners had agreed to sponsor only 26 episodes whereas the respondents had agreed to produce 52 episodes and had given a firm commitment to that effect to doordarshan as is clear from the letter dated 12 july 1984 sent by the respondents to doordarshan. the trial court thus rightly noted that there was no agency between the parties. 3 that the titles of each episode indicated that respondent no 2 is the producer of the said serial and the petitioners are only the sponsors. as late as on 22 april 1985 the petitioners communicated their displeasure on this display in the episodes as to the titles. however the titles continued to show mr. s s oberoi as the producer of the serial and the petitioners did not withhold payments. 4 that the courts below have refuted the claim of the petitioners that the bill dated 19 march 1984 establishes the fact that the production work had been started by the respondents at the behest of the petitioners. it has been proved that the said bill was ante dated and raised by the respondents in july 1984 ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting the petitioners for their obtaining tax concessions. 5 that the doordarshan which have been impleaded as a party in their written statement stated that they recognize the respondents as producers of the said serial and recognize the petitioners as sponsors only. 6 that the evidence of mr. s s gill who gave evidence on behalf of the information   broadcasting ministry that he was not acquainted with mr. pendharkar and that doordarshan had no direct connection with the petitioners but only with the respondents as producers or the director stood un impeached. in his further evidence mr. gill stated that some time in the month of may june 1984 he had met kundan shah and requested to make a comedy serial for doordarshan which clearly indicated that it is only the respondents who were dealing with doordarshan. 7 that the video rights were assigned to esquire distributing   servicing pvt. ltd by the respondents pursuant to letters dated 14 december 1984 and 15 november 1985 and had received royalty for the video rights and the original u matic cassettes were returned to them by esquire distributing   servicing pvt. ltd as their property. 8 that there was no transfer of rights in favour of the petitioners by the respondents in the aforesaid letters and no consideration whatsoever was paid to the respondents for issuing the said letters which have no legal consequences and it was after the petitioners received the letter dated 19 october 1985 from esquire distributing   servicing pvt. ltd that the respondents were asked by the petitioners to issue another letter in this regard. thus the pleadings and the evidence on record clearly indicated that the respondents were not the agents of the petitioners for the purpose of producing the said serial. the aggregate amount of rs 76 50 lakhs which was paid to the respondents for 60 episodes is not the amount for cost of production but the fixed price for sponsoring the said serial in order to link up their advertisement with the serial and avail substantial benefit of concessional rate under the scheme envisaged by doordarshan. the respondents were not liable to render accounts to the petitioners who paid them a fixed sum for sponsoring the programme. if the expenses were less the petitioners did not ask for a refund and the profit or loss was entirely of the respondents. it is clear that the bills that have been raised were only to accommodate the petitioners from the circumstances narrated above. however the learned counsel for the petitioners made elaborate reference to the income tax act 1961 and the provisions whether such availment of benefit could be taken or not pursuant to the amendment effected to the provisions relating to computation of business income at different stages may not be very germane to the present case. it is probable that the respondents had obliged the petitioners by issuing these bills because the bills cannot be read in isolation but with reference to surrounding circumstances. therefore the view taken by the courts below in this regard appears to be correct. so far as the contentions raised on the basis of s 17 of the copyright act is concerned it is clear that the petitioners were not able to establish that the respondent nos 1 to 4 produced the said serial  1  as the agents of the petitioners   2  in the course of their employment with the petitioners   3  for valuable consideration paid by the petitioners to them  and  iv  at the instance of the petitioners. when these factors had not been established and the suit is itself not dependent on the interpretation of s 17 of the copyright act pleadings and issues raised did not attract the same. on appreciation of evidence the courts below have come to the conclusion that the respondents did not make the said serial for valuable consideration at the instance of the petitioners and in view of the findings of fact the claim of copyright or ownership in respect of the serial u s 17 b  and  c  would not arise at all.

[Facts] municipal corporation of delhi aggrieved against the judgment and final order dated 26 03 2004 passed by the high court delhi in criminal revision petition no 185 of 2004 by which order the high court gave the benefit of probation under section 4 of the probation of offenders act 1958. herein after referred to as  pob act   to the second respondent gurcharan singh but maintained the conviction preferred the above appeal. the brief facts leading to the filing of the above appeal are as under. one mr. m k verma. pw 4  junior engineer civil line zone visited 189 prem gali punja sharif mori gate where he found unauthorized construction going at the first floor of the said plot. f i r was prepared on the report of mr. m k verma who forwarded the f i r before zonal engineer who ordered to issue notice under section 343 344 of the delhi municipal corporation act 1957  for short the  dmc act   subsequently the second respondent along with kuldeep singh were prosecuted for commission of offences under sections 332 and 461 of the dmc act before the designated municipal court. aggrieved by that order the second respondent accused filed an appeal before the sessions court delhi. against the judgment and order dated 23 3 2004 the accused filed criminal revision petition no 185 of 2004 before the high court delhi. the appellant aggrieved by the judgment of the high court preferred the above appeal by way of special leave petition before this court. the additional sessions judge new delhi also in civil appeal no 7 of 2002  annexure p 2  dismissed the appeal as there is no infirmity in the order of the trial court and uphold the conviction order passed by the trial court on the point of sentence. the appellate court held that no interference is required in the order passed by the trial court regarding point of sentence.
[Ratio of the decision] we have perused the entire pleadings orders and judgments passed by the lower courts and also of the high court the other annexures in particular annexures p 1 and p 2 and records annexed to this appeal and also heard the arguments of mr. ashwani kumar learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant mr. vikas sharma learned counsel appearing for respondent no 1 and mr. jaspal singh learned senior counsel appearing for the second respondent. in the above background two questions of law arise for consideration by this court   1 whether the high court was correct in extending the benefit of the probation of offenders act 1958 to the accused respondent without calling for a report from the authorities relating to the conduct of the respondent as per section 4 of the act. 2 whether. the high court was correct in passing the impugned judgment in view of the fact that the respondent has been convicted in another criminal case no 202 of 1997 by the trial court new delhi. it is the specific case of the appellant herein that the high court has not afforded to the appellant an opportunity to file counter affidavit. the appellant would have filed the orders passed by the criminal courts convicting the respondent herein had an opportunity been given to the appellant. the high court while passing the impugned order and judgment did not take into consideration that the accused respondent has been convicted in another criminal case no 202 of 1997 by the court of metropolitan magistrate patiala house new delhi. in the said case the accused has been convicted under sections 332 461 of the dmc act and sentenced to six months simple imprisonment with fine of rs 5000 in our view there was no good reason for letting the respondent off by granting to him the said benefit of pob act particularly keeping in view the large scale irregularity and unauthorized constructions carried by the builders in delhi despite strict direction of the municipal authorities and despite of the courts passing various orders from time to time against the unauthorized construction. the high court also failed to take into consideration that the respondent has been in jail for three days and had not put in substantial period in custody. the high court vide its order impugned in this appeal has observed that there is no allegation that the respondent is a previous convict. in fact as could be seen from the annexures filed along with this appeal the respondent has been convicted for offence under sections 332 and 461 of the dmc act. since the appellant mcd was not given any opportunity by the high court to file conduct report of the respondent the order impugned in this appeal is liable to be set aside. this apart the respondent did not also disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the high court that he has also been convicted in another criminal case no 202 of 1997 by the court of metropolitan magistrate patiala house new delhi. thus the contesting respondent has come to the high court with unclean hands and withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side. in our opinion he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well as on the opposite party. a person whose case is based on falsehood can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. we have no hesitation to say that a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to approach the court and he can be summarily thrown out at any stage of the litigation. in the instant case non production of the order and even non mentioning of the conviction and sentence in the criminal case no 202 of 1997 tantamounts to playing fraud on the court. a litigant who approaches the court is bound to produce all documents which are relevant to the litigation. if he withholds a vital document in order to gain advantage on the other side then he would be guilty of playing fraud on the court as well on the opposite party. the second respondent in our opinion was not justified in suppressing the material fact that he was convicted by the magistrate on an earlier occasion. since the second respondent deliberately suppressed the crucial and important fact we disapprove strongly and particularly the conduct of the second respondent and by reason of such conduct the second respondent disentitled himself from getting any relief or assistance from this court. we however part with this case with heavy heart expressing our strong disapproval of the conduct and behaviour but direct that the second respondent to pay a sum of rs 10 000 by way of cost to the appellant herein. while extending benefit of this case the discretion of the court has to be exercised having regard to the circumstances in which the crime was committed the age character and antecedents of the offender. such exercise of discretion needs a sense of responsibility. the offender can only be released on probation of good conduct under this section when the court forms an opinion having considered the circumstances of the case the nature of the offence and the character of the offender that in a particular case the offender should be released on probation of good conduct. the section itself is clear that before applying the section the magistrate should carefully take into consideration the attendant circumstances. the second respondent is a previous convict as per the records placed before us. such a previous convict cannot be released in view of section 4 of the pob act. the court is bound to call for a report as per section 4 of pob act but the high court has failed to do so although the court is not bound by the report of the probationer officer but it must call for such a report before the case comes to its conclusion. since the high court has disposed of the criminal revision without giving an opportunity of filing counter affidavit to the counsel for the mcd and that the respondent did not disclose the fact in the criminal revision filed before the high court that he has also been convicted in another criminal case no 202 of 1997 the judgment impugned in this appeal cannot be allowed to stand. we therefore have no hesitation in setting aside the order impugned and remit the matter to the high court for fresh disposal strictly in accordance with law.

[Facts] challenge in this appeal is to the order of a division bench of madras high court allowing the appeal filed by the respondent  hereinafter referred to as the  accused   the accused was convicted for offence punishable under section 302 of the indian penal code 1860  in short the  ipc   and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of rs 10 000  with default stipulation by principal district judge madurai. he was also convicted for offences punishable under section 392 read with section 397 ipc and sentence to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine. background facts in a nutshell are as follows. the deceased is one mayurani a sri lankan student who was residing in the first floor of the house belonging to one solsimalai  p w 1  the accused is also a sri lankan student studying in a different college but staying in the second floor of the same premises. the occurrence allegedly took place in the afternoon of 22 4 2003. the first information report was lodged by p w 1 on 24 4 2003 at about 9 30 a m it was indicated in the first information report that on 24 4 2003 at 9 00 a m  while the informant had gone to perform pooja in the first floor of the house he got foul smell in the last room of the first floor and found blood seeping through the front door. on opening the window he noticed that mayurani was lying in a pool of blood with her face covered with a bag. on the basis of the aforesaid f i r  investigation was taken up initially by p w 40. subsequently on the basis of the order of the high court such investigation was completed by p w 42 the accused is stated to have been arrested on suspicion on 26 4 2003 on the basis of the statement of the accused prosecution discovered many materials including a knife and a log allegedly used for killing. initially p w 40 suspected the role of p w 1 his wife p w 2 p w 3 from whose house certain incriminating material were recovered allegedly on the basis of statement of the accused as well as p w 4 who was working as a cleaner in the vehicle of p w 1 subsequently however p w 42 who took over investigation from p w 40 filed charge sheet only against the present appellant on the footing that p ws 1 to 4 had no role to play in the crime. the prosecution relied upon only circumstantial evidence namely confessional statements of the accused leading to recovery of various incriminating materials. ex p 6 is the statement leading to recovery of travel bags  m os 2   3  knife   m 0 5  wooden log  m 0 28  rubber gloves  m 0 29 series  cotton rope with human hair  mn o 30 series  two sponges soaked with blood  m 0 31 series  bloodstained blue clolour jean pant  m 0 32  bloodstained white banian  m 0 33  colour banian  m 0 34  bloodstained grey colour pant  m 0 35  bloodstained pillow  m 0 36  plastic bucket  m 0 37  from the house of p w 3 ex p 8 is the statement leading to recovery of computer and its accessories  m os 6 to 17  from the house of p w 15 a classmate of the accused. ex p 10 is the statement relating to jewelleries ultimately leading to recovery of gold ingots  m o 18 series  from the house of p w 19 on the basis of other connecting statements of p w 17 and p w 18 these three statements exs. p 6 p 8 and p 10 dated 26 4 2003 were made before p w 40 in the presence of p w 22 and c w 1 the other confessional statement ex p 12 dated 22 9 2003 made before p w 42 and subbiah and p w 24 led to recovery of  m  dollar  m 0 38  and key chain with key chain in  m 0 39  from the toilet in the room of the accused. the prosecution has also relied upon the alleged motive to the effect that the accused urgently wanted money with a view to increase his marks in mathematics and therefore the accused had stolen articles belonging to the deceased. the trial court found the respondent guilty and recorded conviction and imposed sentence as aforestated. the trial court found that the prosecution version rested on circumstantial evidence. the following circumstances were highlighted to find the accused guilty. a. the death is homicidal   b. the accused was in need of money to chase mathematics paper and for the aforesaid purpose he has killed the deceased to take away the valuable articles like computer and gold ornaments to sell such articles in the market. c. at the time of occurrence only the accused deceased and pw 9 were available in the premises and there was no other person. d  statement of the accused leading to recovery of incriminating materials such as knife rope clothes wooden log and other valuable articles such as computer gold ornaments  m. dollar and the key chain with key belonging to the deceased. the high court found that the circumstances highlighted were not sufficient to fasten the guilt on the accused and directed acquittal. learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the high court failed to notice that the circumstances highlighted clearly establish the chain of circumstances which established the prosecution version and the high court was not justified in directing acquittal. learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the judgment of the high court. the conviction based on circumstantial evidence has been highlighted by this court in various orders of this court. significantly the prosecution has relied upon the evidence of pw 40 who was investigating initially. his evidence has to be considered in the background of what has been stated by pw 22 and cw 1 it has been accepted by the prosecution that great efforts were made by pw 40 to falsely implicate to pws 1 to 4 and for that purpose a departmental proceeding was initiated. even according to the statement of the subsequent investigating officer  pw 42  several blank papers with the signature of pw 22 and cw 1 had been by pw 40 and such documents had been used to create false records to implicate pws 1 to 4 it is to be noted that pw 2 himself was one of the suspected person at the initial stage of investigation.
[Ratio of the decision] it has been consistently laid down by this court that where a case rests squarely on circumstantial evidence the inference of guilt can be justified only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused or the guilt of any other person  see hukam singh v. state of rajasthan air  1977 sc 1063 1977 indlaw sc 433   eradu and ors v. state of hyderabad  air 1956 sc 316 1955 indlaw sc 108   earabhadrappa v. state of karnataka  air 1983 sc 446 1983 indlaw sc 161   state of u p v. sukhbasi and ors  air 1985 sc 1224 1985 indlaw sc 71   balwinder singh v. state of punjab  air 1987 sc 350 1986 indlaw sc 35   ashok kumar chatterjee v. state of m p  air 1989 sc 1890 1989 indlaw sc 443  the circumstances from which an inference as to the guilt of the accused is drawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal fact sought to be inferred from those circumstances. sir alfred wills in his admirable book  wills  circumstantial evidence   chapter vi  lays down the following rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence   1  the facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum   2  the burden of proof is always on the party who asserts the existence of any fact which infers legal accountability   3  in all cases whether of direct or circumstantial evidence the best evidence must be adduced which the nature of the case admits   4  in order to justify the inference of guilt the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that of his guilt   5  if there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused he is entitled as of right to be acquitted. there is no doubt that conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence but it should be tested by the touch stone of law relating to circumstantial evidence laid down by the this court as far back as in 1952. these aspects were highlighted in state of rajasthan v. rajaram  2003 8  scc 180 2003 indlaw sc 630  state of haryana v. jagbir singh   anr  2003 11  scc 261 2003 indlaw sc 807. the main circumstances relied upon by the prosecution relates to the statements of the accused leading to discovery of materials facts admissible under section 27 of the indian evidence act 1872  in short the  evidence act. law is well settled that the prosecution while relying upon the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles under section 27 of the evidence act has to prove through cogent evidence that the statement has been made voluntarily and leads to discovery of the relevant facts. the scope and ambit of section 27 of the evidence act had been stated and restated in several decisions of this court. at one time it was held that the expression  fact discovered  in the section is restricted to a physical or material fact which can be perceived by the senses and that it does not include a mental fact now it is fairly settled that the expression  fact discovered  includes not only the physical object produced but also the place from which it is produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this as noted in pulukuri kottaya s case 1946 indlaw pc 23  supra. the various requirements of the section can be summed up as follows. the fact of which evidence is sought to be given must be relevant to the issue. it must be borne in mind that the provision has nothing to do with the question of relevancy. the relevancy of the fact discovered must be established according to the prescriptions relating to relevancy of other evidence connecting it with the crime in order to make the fact discovered admissible. the fact must have been discovered. the discovery must have been in consequence of some information received from the accused and not by the accused s own act. the person giving the information must be accused of any offence. he must be in the custody of a police officer. the discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from an accused in custody must be deposed to. 7  thereupon only that portion of the information which relates distinctly or strictly to the fact discovered can be proved. the rest is inadmissible. as observed in pulukuri kottaya s case 1946 indlaw pc 23  supra  it can seldom happen that information leading to the discovery of a fact forms the foundation of the prosecution case. it is one link in the chain of proof and the other links must be forged in a manner allowed by law. to similar effect was the view expressed in k chinnaswamy reddy v. state of a p  air 1962 sc 1788 1962 indlaw sc 192. the above position was highlighted in anter singh v. state of rajasthan  air 2004 sc 2665 2004 indlaw sc 79. that apart materials on record such as the statement of p w 22 recorded under section 164 of the code of criminal procedure 1973. in short  the code   and the statement of c w 1 raise a reasonable doubt relating to voluntariness of the alleged confession. p w 22 who is a close relation of the deceased  cousin  has stated that two days after the occurrence after the information that bala prasanna was roaming near lic colony anna nagar police brought him to the police station and bala prasanna was arrested at 5 00 p m and was taken to the police station and a witness was present there. it is further stated that at the time of enquiry the accused was beaten up by the police and they have seized a gold ring and rs 5000  cash from him. if this is the statement of p w 22 recorded under section 164 of the code a witness in whose presence the confessional statement leading to discovery of articles from the house of hajeeali p w 3 had been made it raises serious doubt regarding the voluntariness of the statement. in this context it is also note worthy to indicate that c w 1 in his evidence has stated that the accused was in police station on 24 4 2003 itself. similar statement is made by p w 4 that apart c w 1 has stated that no statement has been made in his presence. the prosecution version to the effect that even some signatures on blank papers had been taken from p w 22 and c w 1 thus assumes great importance. the alleged statement made by the accused led to discovery of knife bloodstained clothes rope etc. unfortunately for the prosecution there is no evidence to show that in fact the wearing apparels containing bloodstains belonged to the accused save and except the alleged confessional statement. no witness has spoken that those clothes were worn by the accused at any time far less at or about the time of occurrence. it is also to be kept in view that those articles were recovered from the house of p w 3 and at the initial stage of investigation p w 3 himself was one of the suspected person and he was arrested. therefore the statement of p w 3 and his mother that those articles were brought by the accused and left in the upstairs room is to be considered with a pinch of salt. moreover there is nothing to indicate that in fact the bloodstained clothes and rope had tallied with the blood grouping of the deceased. the knife did not contain any bloodstain. therefore the aspect relating to recovery of articles from the house of p w 3 and his mother cannot be considered as a link to complete the chain of circumstantial evidence. the next recovery relates to recovery of computer and accessories. apart from the fact that there is niggling doubt about the so called confession in view of statement under section 164 of the code of p w 22 and the statement of c w 1 a further doubt is raised regarding such aspect in view of evidence of c w 1 to the effect that he had seen such computer in the room of the deceased when they had gone to the room after the offence was reported. the fact that c w 1 is a close relation of the deceased adds weight to his evidence rather than taking it away. even accepting that the computer had been given to p w 15 by the accused such circumstance by itself does not unerringly points towards the guilt of the accused either in respect of offence of murder or even robbery. it is quite possible that such articles might have been borrowed by the accused from the deceased and not necessarily stolen by the accused from the deceased after killing her. the fact that p w 9 had not initially stated anything before p w 40 about the accused coming down with computer at 3 30 p m and stated so for the first time when she was re examined after 5 months cannot be lost sight of. as a matter of fact p w 9 who was examined on the very date when police started investigation did not inform the police that she had seen the accused coming down from upstairs or that the accused had threatened her. her statement to the following   i did not tell anyone that balaprasanna took away the computer and threatened me. i did not tell this even to the inspector of police after going to the police station. i do not tell this even to p w 1. the next recovery relates to the ingots. for the aforesaid aspect the evidence of p ws 17 18 and 19 is relevant. since the golden jewellery had been molten and were recovered in the shape of ingots it would be very hazardous to come to the conclusion that in fact the golden jewellery belonged to the deceased. if the accused had killed the deceased and stolen those golden jewellery there is no reason as to why he had also not taken ear rings from the deceased. the fact that ear rings were on the dead body is admitted by the prosecution. the prosecution has strongly relied upon the fact that  m  dollar belonging to the deceased and a chain with key of the room of the deceased were discovered from inside the toilet in the room which was previously occupied by the accused. for the aforesaid purpose they have relied upon the evidence of p w 42 and the seizure witness p w 24 the accused had allegedly made earlier confessional statement before p w 40 on 26 4 2003 leading to discovery of several articles. the subsequent statement spoken to by p w 42 the subsequent investigating officer is alleged to have been made only in september 2003 after about five months. so far as the first confession statement made before p w 40 is concerned admittedly the accused was under physical custody at that time whereas at the time of last confession stated to have been made before p w 42 the accused was on bail and he had been summoned by p w 42 for further examination and therefore technically in custody. if the accused had not made such a statement at such first instance when he had confessed about other articles it is not understood as to how after 5 months when he was on bail he would make such a statement. such alleged confession made belatedly thus creates doubt regarding its authenticity or voluntariness. in this context it is to be noted that c w 1 states that  m  dollar was taken from him by p w 42 for the purpose of facilitating investigation. keeping in view the fact that c w 1 is a close relation of the deceased and obviously interested in punishing the real culprit such a statement coming from c w 1 cannot be slightly brushed aside. the fact that there had been a statement allegedly made by p w 1 leading to recovery of a parallel key from the dash board of the car of p w 1 cannot be lost sight of. it is of course true that the prosecution has tried to exonerate p w 1 by adducing evidence through p ws 36 and 39 to the effect that immediately after recovery of the dead body p w 40 had taken two such keys thus contradicting the alleged confession of p w 1 however the very suspicious role of p w 40 who apparently was in possession of at least two keys of the same lock creates suspicion regarding recovery of another key after 5 months. law is well settled that when the prosecution relies upon circumstantial evidence all the links in the chain of circumstances must be complete and should be proved through cogent evidence. when the judgment of the high court is analysed in the background of what has been stated by this court as regards circumstantial evidence the inevitable conclusion is that the impugned judgment of the high court does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference.

[Facts] these three appeals by special leave are directed against the order dated september 9 2004 passed by intellectual property appellate board  for short  ipab   whereby it ordered the removal of appellant s mark  infosys  from the register of trade marks in respect of computer stationery computer manuals printed matter for computer instructional and teaching materials computer hardware and peripherals and machine and machine tools. the appellant is infosys technologies limited. it was incorporated and registered under the companies act 1956 on july 2 1981 in the name of infosys consultants private limited. the appellant got the trade mark  infosys  registered in 1987 in classes 16 and 9 in connection with computer stationery computer manuals printed manual for computer instruction and teaching materials  computer hardwares computer interface computer peripherals electronics telex interface and in 1988 in class 7 in connection with machine and machine tools and motors  not for land vehicles  the particulars with reference to the trade mark registered by the appellant are as follows. on april 21 1992 the name of the company infosys consultants pvt. limited was changed to infosys technologies pvt. ltd and thereafter on june 2 1992 the name was changed to the present name i e. infosys technologies limited. the first respondent is jupiter infosys limited. the first respondent was incorporated and registered in september 1978 under the name of jupiter agencies pvt. limited. the name of the first respondent was changed to jupiter infosys  p  limited in august 1995 and now since july 2003 the name is changed to jupiter international limited. on october 11 1996 the appellant instituted a suit in the calcutta high court for perpetual injunction inter alia restraining the first respondent from infringing the appellant s mark  infosys  by using the mark  infosys  by itself or in combination with other marks in course of its trade. the appellant also prayed for an interim order in the suit. on november 22 1996 the calcutta high court by an ad interim order restrained the first respondent from using the word  infosys  in any manner in relation to the goods for the time being. the ad interim order was confirmed on november 29 1996. the appellant having come to know of several instances of misuse of mark  infosys  also filed a writ petition  being writ petition no 14214 of 2000  before the calcutta high court inter alia praying that the registrar of companies be restrained from registering the companies bearing the name  infosys  on september 13 2000 the calcutta high court restrained the department of company affairs and registrar of companies from incorporating any company bearing the name  infosys  without the permission of the appellant. in january 2001 the appellant filed yet another suit before the high court of judicature at madras for permanent injunction restraining the first respondent from offering shares to the public as claimed in the initial public offer  ipo  using  infosys  the single judge of the madras high court passed an interim restraint order on february 1 2001 against the first respondent. the said order was confirmed on may 22 2001 to remain operative till disposal of suit. the first respondent then filed three separate applications before the madras high court inter alia under sections 46 and 56 of the trade and merchandise marks act 1958. the 1958 act   in o p no 764 of 2001 the first respondent prayed for the removal rectification of the entry in the register of trade mark in respect of trade mark no 475269 in class 16 while in the other two applications being o p no 765 of 2001 and o p no 766 of 2001 the first respondent prayed for removal rectification of trade mark no 475267 in class 9 and trade mark no 484837 in class 7 respectively. the appellant opposed these applications on diverse grounds by filing counter affidavits. on august 12 2003 the madras high court framed the following issues. a  whether the mark applied for registration was used in respect of the goods for which the mark was registered. b  whether the respondent had a bonafide intention to use the mark applied for under section 18 of the trade and merchandise marks act. c whether the mark registered in favour of the respondent is a service mark. d whether there is a non use of registered trade mark by the respondent for a period of over 5 years and 1 month. e whether the registered trade mark is disentitled for protection in a court of law under section 11 e  of the trade and merchandise marks act. f whether the registered trade mark has lost its distinctiveness and is liable to be removed under section 32 c. g  whether the respondent has committed fraud while obtaining registration of the mark and. h to what further relief. the 1958 act was repealed by the trade marks act 1999  for short  the 1999 act   in terms of section 100 of the 1999 act the three petitions filed by the first respondent before the madras high court for rectification removal of registered trade mark nos 475269 475267 and 484837 were transferred to the ipab. some more facts may be noticed. the appellant filed yet another suit  being suit no 2115 of 2002  before delhi high court for infringement of trade mark and passing off against the first respondent. in that suit the appellant also made an application for grant of temporary injunction. the vacation judge of the delhi high court on december 27 2002 passed an order of temporary injunction against the first respondent as follows   notice for 24th march 2003 before the joint registrar. heard. perused the averments made in the suit and application which are duly supported by documents on record. i am of the opinion that in case ex parte ad interim orders are not granted the relief claimed itself may be rendered infructuous. accordingly it is directed that pending further consideration of the matter after notice for the next date of hearing the defendants are restrained by themselves their directors employees agents and or others acting on its behalf from using the trade mark corporate name infosys or any other mark name deceptively similar trade mark or colourable imitation thereof as a mark and or corporate name or as part of a mark and or business name in respect of goods and or services for publicity on propaganda on websites and or in domain names in any way whatsoever thereby causing infringement of the registered trade mark infosys of the plaintiff in isolation or in combination with words letters numbers their advertisements as part of their corporate name either in isolation or in goods and services or in or by way of any advertisement publicity campaigns etc. compliance of order xxxix rule 3 cpc within three days. the said suit was transferred to the court of the additional district judge tis hazari court delhi. in that suit an affidavit came to be filed by the first respondent wherein it was stated that the name of the company has been changed from jupiter infosys limited to jupiter international limited and a certificate to that effect has been issued by the registrar of companies kolkata under the companies act 1956 and no dispute remains between the parties under the trade mark. the relevant statement made in the affidavit dated july 14 2003  we were informed that the date of the affidavit is july 14 2004  reads as follows    that in the meantime the defendant has already changed the trade mark namely  jupiter international ltd   in place of  jupiter infosys ltd. the copy of the incorporation on change of name which was issued by the registrar of the companies are being marked and annexed herewith as annexure a. that now there is no dispute between the plaintiff and defendant under the trade mark. based on this affidavit the suit was partially decreed in favour of the appellant on november 10 2004. in 2007 however the first respondent filed a suit in the court of additional district judge delhi for setting aside the decree dated november 10 2004 that suit is said to be pending. the ipab proceeded with the matter in light of the issues that were already framed by the high court and heard the parties. the ipab in the impugned order while dealing with the plea of limitation raised by the appellant held that the first respondent was the appropriate aggrieved party in the matter in view of the fresh cause of action having arisen to the first respondent on filing of civil suit no 71 of 2001 by the appellant before the madras high court. the ipab in the impugned order held that the trade mark nos 475269 475267 and 484837 have not been used by the appellant for more than a period of five years and one month and the appellant also failed to make out that it had been in manufacturing or trading of the goods for which it had taken registration nos 475269 475267 and 484837 consequently the ipab allowed the applications made by the first respondent purportedly under section 46 1  b  of the 1958 act and directed the registrar to remove these registrations from the register. we heard mr. akhil sibal learned counsel for the appellant and mr. vaibhav gaggar learned counsel for the first respondent at quite some length. pertinently the notice was issued in the petitions for special leave to appeal to the respondents on november 1 2004 in response to the said notice the first respondent filed counter affidavit before this court on march 11 2005 wherein no specific objection about invocation of jurisdiction of this court directly has been taken. in the counter affidavit a very vague objection in the following terms was raised   that the present petition apart from being false and misconceived lacks the necessary jurisdiction hence deserves outright rejection.
[Ratio of the decision] having regard to the order that we intend to make we are not persuaded to accept the objection raised on behalf of the first respondent that present appeal preferred directly before this court from the impugned order passed by the ipab is not maintainable and must be dismissed as such. we are afraid this is hardly an objection about maintainability. apart from it on september 12 2005 after hearing both parties special leave was granted by this court. in the backdrop of these peculiar facts in our view it is not appropriate to relegate the  17 appellant at this distance of time to challenge the impugned order passed by the ipab in writ petition before the high court. the objection about maintainability of the appeals is accordingly overruled. the moot question which has been debated before us is whether or not the first respondent is an aggrieved person. that the first respondent filed composite applications under sections 46 and 56 of the 1958 act for rectification removal of the trade mark  infosys  registered in classes 7 9 and 16 is not in dispute. the position that emerges from the above provisions is this. whether the application is under section 46 or under section 56 or a composite application under both sections it is a pre requisite that the applicant must be a person aggrieved. section 46 1  of the 1958 act enables any person aggrieved to apply for removal of registered trade mark from the register on the ground of non use as stated in clause  a  and or clause  b  to be an aggrieved person under section 46 he must be one whose interest is affected in some possible way  it must not be a fanciful suggestion of grievance. a likelihood of some injury or damage to the applicant by such trade mark remaining on the register may meet the test of locus standi. in kerly s law of trade marks and trade names  11th edition  at page 166 the legal position with regard to  person aggrieved  has been summarized thus the persons who are aggrieved are all persons who are in some way or the other substantially interested in having the mark removed where it is a question of removal from the register  including all persons who would be substantially damaged if the mark remained and all trade rivals over whom an advantage was gained by a trader who was getting the benefit of a registered trade mark to which he was not entitled. we accept the above statement of law. insofar as section 56 is concerned it provides for varying situations in which the person aggrieved may apply for rectification of the registered trade mark from the register. although both sections namely sections 46 and 56 require  person aggrieved  to apply for removal of the registered trade mark from the register or rectification of a trade mark in the register the expression  person aggrieved  for the purposes of these two sections has different connotations. the interpretation of the expression  person aggrieved  occurring in sections 46 and 56 has come up for consideration before this court on more than one occasion. but if the ground for rectification is merely based on non user i e under section 46 of the act that is not really on account of any public mischief by way of an incorrect entry. the non user does not by itself render the entry incorrect but it gives a right to a person whose interest is affected to apply for its removal. an applicant must therefore show that  in some possible way he may be damaged or injured if the trade mark is allowed to stand  and by  possible  i mean possible in a practical sense and not merely in a fantastic view. all cases of this kind where the original registration is not illegal or improper ought to be considered as questions of common sense to a certain extent at any rate  and i think the applicants ought to show something approaching a sufficient or proper reason for applying to have the trade mark expunged. it certainly is not sufficient reason that they are at loggerheads with the respondents or desire in some way to injure them. addisons  application was one under section 46 and the test to determine whether the applicant was a  person aggrieved  within the meaning of that section should have been the one laid down by romer j in wright case and not the one propounded by the house of lords in the matter of powell s trade mark. the high court and the joint registrar fell into error in not drawing this distinction. however it is not necessary to dilate on this aspect of the matter as the appellant has really argued on the second and third aspects of section 46 viz the alleged non use of the trade marks by hardie and special circumstances. in the case of hardie trading ltd 2003 indlaw sc 756 1 this court approved the test applied by romer j in the royal baking powder company v. wright crossley and co  1898. 15 rpc 677  which has been reproduced in the report. we respectfully agree. hardie trading ltd 2003 indlaw sc 756 1 has been followed by this court in a recent decision in the case of kabushiki kaisha toshiba   2008  10 scc 766  2008 indlaw sc 1395. this court stated that section 46 speaks for private interest while section 56 speaks of a public interest. it is true that the appellant in opposition to the applications for removal rectification of trade mark did not specifically challenge in its counter affidavits the locus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person aggrieved. obviously in the absence of any specific objection by the appellant to that effect no specific issue was framed by the high court whether the applicant was an aggrieved person. the applications having been transferred to the ipab in terms of section 100 of the 1999 act the ipab examined the matter in light of the issues that were framed by the high court although in the written submissions before it the objection was raised that the first respondent has ceased to have locus standi in view of the subsequent events particularly change of the name of the first respondent from jupiter infosys ltd to jupiter international ltd. the question is whether in these circumstances it was incumbent upon the ipab to consider and satisfy itself about the locus standi of the first respondent to be heard as a person aggrieved. in our considered view it was. in the first place when the first respondent applied for rectification removal in respect of three registrations in classes 7 9 and 16 it must have shown in respect of each of them that it is a  person aggrieved  and the ipab must have separately considered in respect of each registration the locus standi of the first respondent as the considerations for each entry might not have been common. secondly and more importantly during the pendency of the applications certain events had taken place which had some bearing on the question of locus standi of the first respondent insofar as invocation of section 46  1  of the 1958 act is concerned. in the affidavit filed by the first respondent on july 14 2004 before the court of additional district judge delhi an unequivocal and categorical statement has been made that now there is no dispute between the plaintiff  appellant herein  and defendant  first respondent herein  under the trade mark and that defendant has already changed the trade mark namely  jupiter international ltd   in place of  jupiter infosys ltd. in terms of section 46 1  not only that the applicant has to show that he is an aggrieved person as his interest is being affected but the ipab must also be satisfied before it directs the removal of registered trade mark that the applicant is an aggrieved person before it invokes the power in directing the removal of the  26 registered trade mark. this is so because the pre requisite for exercise of power under section 46 1  is that the applicant is a person aggrieved. the question then arises whether it is sufficient for the applicant to show that he is a person aggrieved when he makes his application or he must continue to remain a person aggrieved until such time as the rectification removal application is finally decided. in our view the grievance of the applicant when he invokes section 46 1  must not only be taken to have existed on the date of making application but must continue to exist when such application is decided. if during the pendency of such application the applicant s cause of complaint does not survive or his grievance does not subsist due to his own action or the applicant has waived his right or he has lost his interest for any other reason there may not be any justification for rectification as the registered trade mark cannot be said to operate prejudicially to his interest. we concur with the above statement. in the circumstances we are satisfied that the applications made by the first respondent for rectification removal of the subject trade marks from the register need to be considered afresh by the ipab in accordance with law and the observations made above. since the first respondent has also grievance in connection with the impugned order particularly with regard to non consideration of its case under section 56 of the 1958 act we refrain from going into the merits of the diverse contentions raised before us and leave the parties to agitate these contentions before the ipab.

[Facts] this appeal by special leave is from the judgment and order of the high court of andhra pradesh dated 15th april 1986. on or about th of april 1948 sail nawaz jung the then ruler of mukkalla state south yeman in arabia settled some of the properties with which the appeal is concerned by a registered tamleeknama in favour of his son sultan awaz and his grandson galib bin awaz. in 1954 there was wakfnama by the said sail nawaz jung. on or about 23rd of august 1963. the military estate officer secunderabad of. andhra pradesh requested for the requisition of the property named as  sail gulshan  with a vast extent of land and palaces with roads and surrounded by a compound wail measuring 19 acres and 10 guntas situated in the heart of hyderabad city near sarojini devi hospital. the property in question was taken possession of on or about 12th of september 1963. in this appeal we are concerned with the claim for compensation for the said acquisition by one abdul khader who was a flower picker. he had claimed rights as a tenant during the requisition. his claim for compensation for requisition was settled by sharing the rent in or about 1969 the appellant is one of the owners of the property in question deriving their title and right from the said sail nawaz jung. on or about 3rd february 1970 the collector issued notice for acquisition of the property u s 7 1  of the requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property act 1952 being act 30 of 1952. hereinafter called the central act  the gazette notification for the acquisition was issued on 12th march 1970 the controversy in this case relates to the question whether abdul khader was  a protected tenant  under the andhra pradesh  telangana area. tenancy and agricultural lands act 1950 being. act no xxi of 1950. hereinafter called the andhra pradesh act. the purpose of the said act as the preamble states was inter alia to enable the land holders to prevent the excessive sub division of agricultural holdings and empower government to assume in certain circumstances the management of agricultural lands to provide for the registration of co operative farms and to make further provision for matters incidental thereto. suspecting that the entry in the protected tenancy register might not be genuine on or about 24th of october 1970 the tahsildar passed an order cancelling that entry. the main question centres around the right of abdul khader respondent no 1 herein to the compensation awarded by the arbitrator it is therefore necessary to refer to the relevant portion of the said order which inter alia stated as follows   by perusal of the tenancy register of 1958 it is evident that sri mohd. abdul khader is not a genuine protected tenant. the entries of this particular so called tenant is doubtful. i suspect that somebody has tampered the register and entered the name of sri mohd. abdul khader. separate enquiry in this connection is going on in this office to know under what circumstances such entry has been made and copy also issued without knowledge of the tahsildar. hence i suspect the entry and order to cancel the copy of the tenancy issued in favour of sri modh. sd  tahsildar. hyderabad west taluk. this order of cancellation was challenged by abdul khadar by filing a writ petition in the high court of andhra pradesh being w  p no 1786 of 197 1 and by judgment and order passed on 27th august 197. 1 the learned single judge vaidya j held inter alia as follows   whether the petitioner  abdul khader  is a protected tenant or whether he has any prima facie interest in the suit property are matters entirely within the sole jurisdiction of the arbitrator who has to be appointed under s 8 of the  central act. in the appeal of abdul khader the proceedings of revenue divisional officer while questioning entry of the name of abdul khader in the register is a genuine one or net and while it is stated that it was entered in the register in such suspicious way by giving serial no 1 a between serial nos 1 and 2 of register being exhibit a 106 and exhibit a 107 it ultimately held that abdul khader was a protected tenant under section 37a of the andhra pradesh act. on or about 19th of april 1972. the order was passed by the district revenue officer who held that abdul khader was not a protected tenant. he held further that khasra pahani which is the basic record of occupancy period after spot inspections does not find the name of abdul khader and further held that all entries except this entry in the protected tenancy register prepared under section 37a of the andhra pradesh act was supported by an enquiry. it was in those circumstances held by him that the entry was a spurious one. in civil revision petition no 1006 of 1972 which was filed by abdul khader as against others justice r ramachandra raju of the andhra pradesh high court on or about 19th august 1974 held that abdul khader was not a protected tenant and directed deletion of entry made in the final record of tenancies as a spurious one. there was an award by the arbitrator holding that as this court had left it open to decide whether abdul khader was a protected tenant. despite the objection exercising the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to go into the question of protected tenant the arbitrator held that abdul khader was a protected tenant. aggrieved by the aforesaid award the appellant claiming as one of the owners of the property filed a statutory appeal to the high court. in the meantime abdul khader filed an application on or about 21st of october 1984 for adducing additional evidence to mark kaulnama dated 2nd of december 1950 for the first time and oubuliatnama dated 2nd december 1950 as exhibits in deciding the protected tenancy rights. the appellant objected to that application but the high court on 1st april 1985. appointed advocate commissioner to record additional evidence. on or about 22nd of april 1985. the appellant filed the objection reserving the right of raising the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to go into the question whether abdul khader was a protected tenant in the light of the act 21 of 1950 three civil appeals were filed before this court against the order of the high court on 15th may 1985 this court passed the order on 19th august 1985 the said order is important and reads as follows    special leave are granted. the appeal is heard. dr. chitale learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the high court should be directed to consider the issues relating to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator appointed and functioning under the requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property act 195 i to decide whether a person is protected tenant of an agricultural land or not in the light of ss 99 and 102 of the andhra pradesh  telangana area. tenancy and agricultural land act 1950 we have heard the learned counsel for the respondents on the above question. after giving our due consideration to the question we are of the view that the high court should determine this question. the high court shall decide the question of jurisdiction referred to above in light of the submissions to be made by both the parties. shri subba rao learned counsel for the respondents submits that the appellants should not be permitted to withdraw from the authorities concerned more than 40 per cent of the total compensation awarded in respect of the lands in question pending disposal of the appeal before the high court. we agree with his submission. we direct that the appellants shall withdraw not more than 40 per cent of the compensation pending disposal of the appeal before the high court. the remaining 60 per cent shall be disbursed in accordance with the directions to be given by the high court after hearing all the parties concerned. the appeals were disposed of accordingly. other c m ps were filed for clarification of the second part of the order dated 19th august 1985 and this court on 29th november 1985 in cmps. nos 4692 to 4694 of 1985 clarified and ob served that there was no need for further clarification. it was observed that the high court was at liberty to consider the claims to be made by both the parties and pass any fresh order with regard to the disbursement of the remaining 60  of the compensation. the judgment under appeal was passed on 15th of april 1986 this appeal arises out of the said judgment. in the judgment under appeal which is directed against the award made by the arbitrator formulated the following four issues   1  what is the value of the land   2  who are entitled to the compensation amount   3  whether abdul khader is a protected tenant of sail gulshan of the area 19 02 guntas excluding the land of buildings wells etc and  4  what share is to be apportioned to successors of sail nawaz jung. it has to be borne in mind that in the award the arbitrator after exhaustively discussing the evidence on record held that abdul khader was a protected tenant and as such further held that he was entitled to 60  of the compensation money payable for the acquisition of the land excluding the land of buildings wells etc. the high court further modified a portion of the order in view of the decision of this court in bhag singh v. union territory of chandigarh. a i r 1985 s c 1576 1985 indlaw sc 246 on the question of solarium and interest on the amount awarded. the judgment also dealt with the question as to who were the successors of nawaz jung. the high court discussed 18 documents out of which two are challans and other depositions. kowlnama executed in favour of shaik hussain was not filed. the kowlnama executed in favour of the son mohd. abdul khader on december 3 1950 was filed and was marked as exhibit c 1 the document recited   permitted to utilise garden fruits flowers and mango. fruits  the tenant was permitted to raise flower trees at his own expenses. the high court took into consideration the judgment in suit no 13 1  of 195 1 52 by the tenant. the high court on consideration of these documents was of the view that these documents showed unequivocally that the tenancy was in favour of shaik hussain from 1935 after his death mohd. abdul khader was recognised as the tenant. the land was taken possession of under a panchanama dated 12th of september 1963 according to the high court the documents discussed in the judgment indicated that shaik hussain was a tenant from 1935 after his death on july 18 1949 his son mohd. abdul khader became a tenant. in this background the court addressed itself to the question whether abdul khader was a protected tenant or not entitled to 60  of the compensation. the high court was of the view that there was surfeit of evidence prior to the commencement of the andhra pradesh act that shaik hussain was a tenant of the land. the question was whether on enforcement of the said act abdul khader respondent herein was a protected tenant. the high court thereafter discussed the facts mentioned hereinbefore about the order of the district revenue officer and the orders of this court referred to hereinbefore. the high court noticed the position that under the said andhra pradesh act it was for the revenue authorities to order whether a tenant is a protected tenant under section 34 s 37  and section 37a of the said act. section 37a was enacted on 12th of march 1956 the high court was however of the view that it cannot be said that it was for the revenue authorities alone to decide the issue because the arbitrator was ordered to decide the issue by the high court on 19th august 1974 and by this court on 30th of january 1975 the high court also referred to the directions of this court dated 19th august 1985 mentioned hereinbefore. the high court was of the view that the arbitrator was to decide that question and the arbitrator was not in error in deciding the issue in the manner it did. the court reiterated that there was surfeit of evidence to declare that abdul khader was a tenant. if he was a tenant the high court observed he was a protected tenant under s 34 read with s 37 or under section 37 a of the andhra pradesh act.
[Ratio of the decision] it is relevant at this stage to refer to certain provisions of the central act to consider the controversy involved in this appeal the central act was enacted giving power for requisitioning and acquisition of immovable property for union purposes. in this appeal we are concerned with the question whether the high court was right in upholding the award of the arbitrator so far as it has held in favour of abdul khader and his rights to get 60  of the compensation. the high court dealt with the value of the land. we are not concerned with the challenge to this aspect in this appeal. we are also not concerned with this aspect of the matter inasmuch as the same is the subject matter of another appeal being civil appeal no 4406 of 1986. we are concerned in this appeal with the right of abdul khader. no document was filed to show that abdul khader was declared by the revenue courts as a protected tenant. aggrieved by the aforesaid decision the appellants being the successor of the owner of the land in question is in appeal before us. there being no such finding by the revenue officer on the other hand there being a finding mat abdul khader was not a protected tenant by the revenue authorities it was not open to the arbitrator to decide the question of protected tenancy. the arbitrator therefore exceeded his jurisdiction and the high court was in error. we are unable to accept this submission. by the scheme of the central act compensation was payable to persons who had interest in the land acquired. who are the persons who have interest in the land had to be decided in accordance with the law and the evidence. determination by the revenue authorities and non determination is not conclusive or decisive. it is clear that s 102 of the andhra pradesh act mentions that after acquisition the act was not to apply in respect of certain land. therefore it was submitted by the respondents that s 99 of the andhra pradesh act which made the determination by the tahsildar to be final and debarred other courts from going into the question did not apply in case of compensation payable. in the background of the totality of circumstances as manifest in the different orders it appeared to the arbitrator and the court that the entry which was made in favour of abdul khader as the protected tenant was of doubtful validity. we are of the opinion that the high court was not in error in so holding. it was the observation of the revenue authorities that it was spurious. that in any event what was the interest of abdul khader had to be determined in determining the question of payment of compensation to him and in so determining the facts and circumstances and the proceedings before the revenue authorities and entries and subsequent deletions had to be taken into consideration by the arbitrator. the arbitrator has done so. he had jurisdiction to do so. the high court has so held. this court by the two orders referred to hereinbefore had also affirmed this position. in that view of the matter we are unable to accept the challenge to the award. furthermore under s 99 of the andhra pradesh act the bar was not against the arbitrator but against a civil court. in determining the amount of compensation payable to abdul khader under the central act his interests in the property had to be determined. in another context the high court of andhra pradesh enunciated the position that it was necessary to determine the interest of the persons claiming compensation. the land acquisition officer or the court as the case may be had to ascertain the value of a claimant s right in the property acquired and compensate him in that behalf. we may mention that in the two orders of this court dated 30th of january 1975 and 19th of august 1985 referred to herein before this court had left it open to the high court and to the arbitrator to decide whether he is a protected tenant or not the arbitrator has decided that question and the high court found over whelming evidence in support of it. in that view of the matter we must uphold that decision however unsatisfactory. it might appear that a fruit pucker gets 60  of the compensation while the owners get only if that is the law. let it be.

[Facts] the order of the court was as follows. by order dated october 7 1993 passed by the constitution bench three questions were referred for consideration by a larger bench. in pursuance of the said order this bench has been constituted. for admission in the last academic session 1993 94 an interim order in the following terms was made by a bench comprising hon ble the chief justice and one of us  justice b p jeevan reddy  on may 14 1993 in writ petition nos 350 and 355 of 1993. we have heard shri soli j sorabjee learned senior counsel for the petitioners in these two writ petitions. issue rule. there will be an interim order in the following terms   i  fifty per cent of the total intake in the petitioners  educational institutions shall be permitted to be filled up by candidates selected by the agencies of the state government on the basis of a competitive examination test. the candidates so selected and admitted shall pay scales of fee as applicable to this class of students as determined by the state government from time to time. ii. the remaining fifty per cent of the intake may be regulated by the petitioners to admit candidates belonging to the particular religious or linguistic minority. however the selection shall be made strictly on the basis of merit among the candidates seeking admission to the institutions. such merit shall be determined oh the basis of the academic performance at the qualifying examination  or on the basis of any objective test that the institution might itself apply to determine such relative and competing merits  or on the basis of performance of the results of the selection tests that the state government may itself hold for selecting candidates for admission to technical colleges in the state. it is optional for the petitioners to adopt any one of these three modes and apply it uniformally. candidates so selected on the basis of merit amongst the minorities shall however abide by such condition in the matter of payment of tuition and other fee as may be permitted by the state government. thereafter the matter was considered by the constitution bench in its order dated august 18 19932 in that order the writ petitions placed before the bench were categorised into five categories namely  1  unaided minority educational institutions  2. minority educational institutions which are in receipt of state funds by way of aid  3  minority educational institutions in respect of which it is not clear from the averments in the writ petitions whether they are aided or unaided institutions  4. writ petitions challenging the correctness and applicability of unni krishnan  filed by educational institutions which do not claim to be minority educational institutions  5  writ petitions which do not fall in any of the above categories. it was directed that the order dated may 14 1993 would not apply to educational institutions falling in categories  4  and  5  and the institutions referred to in paragraph 18 of the order dated august 18 1993 the order dated may 14 1993 was made applicable to the institutions falling in categories  1   2  and  3  with the modification that following were added in continuation of the said order    in continuation it is made further clear that whether any of the petitioner institutions is a mei or not is a matter for the government to verify and determine. we do not more particularly at this stage  make any pronouncement in that behalf. this order shall be shahal h musaliar v. state of kerala  1993  4 scc. 112 1993 indlaw sc 575 applicable only to those institutions which are found to be meis on verification by the government and not to those who are not found to be meis on such verification. the 50  seats to be filled up by candidates selected by the agencies of the state government on the basis of a competitive examination test as well as the remaining 50  seats to be filled in accordance with cl of the said order shall be equally distributed between free seats and payment seats. in other words out of the 50  seats to be filled up by government half will be payment seats and half will be free seats. similarly out of the 50  of the seats to be filled up by the management in accordance  of the said order half shall be payment seats and the other half free seats. the nris if any admitted to an extent not exceeding 5  of the total seats shall be out of the payment seats to be filled under after completing the admissions each of the colleges shall submit to the competent authority to the university to which it is affiliated and to the government concerned statements containing full particulars of the students admitted under cl  ii  of para  2  of this order. such statements shall contain as full a particulars as possible. the authorities to which the statements are submitted shall verify the correctness of the statements and if they find any irregularity they shall call upon the college concerned to rectify the same. they shall also bring any such violation to the notice of this court by way of any interlocutory application. any such irregularity if proved may entail serious consequences. in the order dated august 18 1993 the following directions were given in respect of the institutions covered by the aforesaid writ petitions nos 284 of 1993 and 482 of 19932    having regard to the above circumstances we permit the petitioners. in the above two writ petitions to admit students to their colleges on the basis of entrance test conducted by them and on the same basis on which admissions were made by them in the said colleges in the previous academic year. after completing the admissions the petitioners shall furnish full particulars of the students admitted the categories if any whereunder they were admitted and all other particulars relating to their admission. this information should be furnished to the competent authority to the university to which the said colleges are affiliated and to the secretary education department government of karnataka tamil nadu. the said authorities shall verify whether the admissions have been made by the petitioners in accordance with the directions given herein. in case of irregularity any of the said authorities shall be entitled to call upon the petitioner to rectify the said irregularity. it shall also be open to the competent authority university and the government of karnataka tamil nadu to bring any such irregularity to the notice of this court by way of an interlocutory application for appropriate orders in that behalf. it is made clear that any violation of the directions given herein by the petitioners shall entail serious consequences inasmuch as the above orders are made based upon their representations and even before a counter affidavit has been filed by the respective respondents in view of the urgency expressed by them. dealing with writ petition no 598 of 1993 the court after noticing that an agreement was entered into between the institution and the government of kerala according to which while 85  of the seats were to be filled by the government and the remaining 15  of the seats were left for the management to fill up in its discretion observed that since the basic principle in unni krishnan  as well as the order dated august 18 1993 is that merit shall be the guiding principle in the matter of admission a plea for discretionary quota could not be countenanced and it was directed that the said writ petition shall also be governed by the order dated may 14 1993 as modified by addition. by order dated october 7 19933 the constitution bench having regard to the fact that the year 1993 being a year of transition and adjustment and also in view of the orders of the government of india permitting admission of foreign students to the extent of as much as 50  of the seats as well as the time that had already elapsed permitted the private professional colleges to admit non resident indians and foreign students up to a maximum extent of 15  of the intake capacity of that year. i e 1993 with the direction that the basis of the said selection would be as indicated in order dated may 14 19934 on the basis of merit leaving to the management of the college t m a pai foundation v. state of karnataka  1993. 4scc276 2002. indlaw sc 2264  unnikrishnan j p v. state of a p   1993  4 scc 111 1993 indlaw sc 1168 concerned to adjudge the merit of these candidates having regard to the relevant factors. it was further made clear that this was a special provision made only for that year. in the aforesaid order dated october 7 19933 with reference to the minority educational institutions in the state of kerala  such as those covered by writ petition no 598 of 1993  it has been observed   the system obtaining in kerala appears to be altogether different which was unfortunately not brought to our notice on august 18 1993 there are only two private engineering colleges in the state said to be minority educational institutions. the system obtaining in this state appears to be that the entire fees collected by these private engineering colleges has to be made over to the government while the government bears the entire expenditure for running the colleges. under this system the colleges were allowed to admit students of their own choice to the extent of 15. we have heard learned counsel for the parties and we are of the view that except for the minority educational institutions in kerala which are governed by the terms of the agreements with the government of kerala the directions given by this court with regard to admissions for the academic session 1993 can continue and govern admissions for the next academic session commencing in 1994 as regards the institutions in the state of kerala which are governed by the terms of agreements with the government of kerala the admissions to such institutions would be made in accordance with those agreements. it is therefore directed that the admission for the academic session commencing in 1994 to the professional courses in the institutions which are claimed to be minority educational institutions shall be made on the following basis   i. in the institutions referred to in writ petitions nos 284 of 1993 and 482 of 1993 admission shall be made as per the directions given in the order dated august 18 19932 for the academic session commencing in 1993. in the institutions referred to in writ petition no 598 of 1993 and similar minority educational institutions in the state of kerala which are governed by an agreement with the government of kerala the admissions shall be made in accordance with the terms of those agreements. in respect of the seats which are left for management to fill in its discretion merit shall be the guiding principle. later when raj narayan singh and others filed writ petition  civil. no 641 of 1991 this court on june 6 1991 directed to convert the writ petition as a contempt case for non implementation of the direction issued in k c joshi case  which was numbered as contempt petition no 164 of 1971 when. it came up for hearing on august. 23 1991 this court observed thus    we are told by the counsel for the state of u p that for the purpose of working out the seniority draft list has been prepared and was in circulation inviting objections. the petitioners therein had not filed any objection despite giving time but it was directed that the state would consider their cases even if they make any representation. in the light of that stand while dismissing the contempt petition this court directed the sate government to dispose of the matter on the basis of the representation that may be received from the petitioners therein against the draft seniority list within six months from that date. in these contempt petitions the promotees as well as some of the subsequent direct recruits complain against fixation of their inter se seniority by the state government.
[Ratio of the decision] in these matters relating to admission to professional courses in medicine engineering pharmacy nursing etc in educational institutions which are claimed to be minority educational institutions the petitioners have questioned the applicability of the scheme framed by this court in j p unni krishnan v. state of a p  1993. 1 scc 645 1993 indlaw sc 1056. i as well as the applicability of the rules and orders made by several state governments on the basis of the said decision. when the matters were taken up on march 16 1994 the court felt that it was necessary to reframe the first two questions. the hearing of the matters was therefore adjourned to march 18 1994 on which date the questions requiring consideration by this bench have been reframed to highlight the several aspects of the claims put forward by the petitioners. the claim of being a  minority   whether based on religion or language  and the claim of being a  minority educational institution  put forward by the petitioners cannot be pronounced upon without first ascertaining what the said expressions connote and signify. having regard to the importance of the questions involved we consider it appropriate to issue notice to the attorney general of india as well as the advocates general for the states. it would therefore not be feasible to take up the hearing of these matters before the court closes for the long vacation. since the process of selection of candidates for admission for the next academic session is to commence soon it is necessary to pass an interim order governing admission to the professional courses in minority educational institutions for the next academic session. it is made clear that this order is made on the assumption that the petitioners are minority institutions. it is open to the respondents to question this status claimed by the petitioners. this order shall however not estop the petitioners from urging all other contentions raised in the writ petitions as indeed this interim interlocutory order is made on the consent of the petitioners and without prejudice to all the contentions. separate directions were however given in respect of institutions referred to in writ petitions nos 284 and 482 of 1993 with regard to writ petition no 284 of 1993 it was observed that in the said writ petition the petitioner has claimed that no capitation fee is charged from any student and the fee charged is not more than  in some cases less than. the fees charged in the government colleges and that the admission to these institutions is made on the basis of an all india common entrance test separately conducted by the petitioner and admissions are made on the basis of merit as determined in the said test and further that in view of the reputation of these institutions thousands of students apply for and appear in the entrance test every year. it was also observed that this fact was not disputed by the learned advocate general for the state of karnataka. similarly as regards writ petition no 482 of 1993 it was observed that according to the petitioner in that case the medical college run by it at vellore in the state of tamil nadu is a well reputed institution admission to which is made on the basis of all india entrance test conducted by the petitioner and that the admissions are made on the basis of merit and the fee charged by it is not more than the fees chargeable in similar governmental institutions and that there has never been any complaint about the working of this institution and it was observed that this fact was not disputed by shri seetharaman learned counsel for the state of tamil nadu. since the entire expenditure of the colleges is borne by the state  the entire fees collected are also made over to the state  these colleges must be required to draw the students even with respect to the seats to be filled by the management from out of the state merit list if any. in the absence of such list they can themselves devise the method for such selection. we make it clear that regarding the character of these institutions  whether they are minority educational institutions  we express no opinion. that is a matter between the institutions and the government of kerala. it is enough to record that shri vellapally learned counsel for the state of kerala disputes the minority character of these institutions. iii. in rest of the minority educational institutions falling in categories  1   2  and  3  indicated in paragraph 5 of the order dated august 18 19932 admission shall be made in accordance with the directions contained in the order dated may 14 1993 in writ petitions nos 350 and 355 of 1993 as modified by order dated august 18 19932 but the directions would not apply to the institutions referred to in paragraph 18 of the order dated august 18 19932 in this context we would like to impress upon the managements of the institutions concerned that while assessing the merit of a candidate for admission the objective should be to promote the excellence of the institution as a vehicle of general secular education. iv. insofar as non resident indians and foreign students are concerned the permissible limit would be only 5  of the total intake for a given year as per the direction contained in paragraph 6 of the order dated may 14 1993 as modified by order dated august 18 19932 the admission against these seats shall be made on the basis of merit. but it would be open for the management of the institution to adjudge the merit of the candidates having regard to the relevant factors. the matters be listed for hearing on july 20 1994 notice be issued to the attorney general of india and the advocates general for the states on the questions as reframed. written submissions  in brief  should be submitted by learned counsel by july 13 1994. the contempt petition nos 65 100 and 126 of 1992 arise out of the judgment of this court in keshav chandra joshi v. union of india  1990 indlaw sc 270 in which this court had directed to determine inter se seniority of the direct recruits and promotee asstt. conservators forests u p rendered on november 6 1990 it would appear that at present there are 215 direct recruits and 100 promotee asstt. conservators forest working in the forest department. we are informed that till date no appointments in terms thereof have been made. the seniority of the promotee asstt. conservators forest shall be counted from the respective dates of appointment to the substantive posts in their quota under rule 6 of the rules. the inter se seniority of the direct recruits and promotees shall be determined in accordance with rules 5 6 and 24 as per the judgment in k c joshi case  all the employees are entitled to all consequential benefits. in the rejoinder the promotees have stated that as on december 31 1974 a total number of 140 posts of asstt. conservators forest were available and their quota as per the existing rules was 25 per cent. as on december 1 1980 186 posts namely 140 and 46 posts created during the period were available. as per the ratio the promotees are entitled to 33 1 3 per cent quota. as on march 11 1985 32 more posts were created and the total posts available were 218 on. december 1 1986 40 more posts were created. therefore as on march ii 1985 the total posts available were. 258 on march 1 1985 the quota was increased by 50 per cent. the promotees therefore are entitled to 50 per cent of the posts. as in the year 1990 72 more posts were created and the total posts are now 330 therefore they are entitled to 50 per cent of the quota in the tentative list. but that was not done. thereby the action of the state is in defiance of the direction issued by this court. the directions issued in k c joshi case  have already been extracted and their need to reiterate is obviated. from the averments it would appear that 100 promotee asstt. conservators forest are awaiting appointment to substantive vacancies. the total number of direct recruits appears to be 215 prior to december 31 1974 the quota was 75 per cent to the direct recruits and 25 per cent to the promotees. similarly as on january 1 1975 the ratio was increased to 33 1 3 per cent namely 66 2 3 per cent to the direct recruits and 33 1 3 per cent to the promotees. indisputably a decision was taken on march 1 1975 to increase the quota to 50 per cent but no amendment to the statutory rules to give effect to it was made. therefore the operative rule as on that date appears to be 33 1 3 per cent in respect of promotees. therefore the procedure to be adopted by the state in fixing the inter se seniority of the direct recruits and the promotees in their respective quota is the sole question. there is no rota prescribed in the rules. therefore the state is enjoined to implement the judgment of this court in the light of the statutory rules. it is clear from the counter affidavit filed by the state that the posts are both permanent and temporary. if the temporary posts are likely to continue for long normally as per the law laid down by this court they be treated for the purpose of counting seniority as permanent posts unless they are likely to be abolished. it is a policy matter. therefore the state has to determine whether the posts are likely to be made permanent or abolished. in the event of converting them as permanent under rule 24 the quota prescribed in rule 6 would be applied to substantive posts. the seniority shall be determined in accordance with the quota rule to the posts available in the respective years in which the vacancies had arisen otherwise existing substantive posts should be filled up applying rule 6 it is therefore incumbent upon the state government to find out how many vacancies were existing in the year 1974 75 and thereafter every year and to determine as to how the respective posts stood reserved for the direct recruits and promotees in accordance with the quota. on so determining the direct recruits would go en block as seniors to the promotees and the promotee officers in the order of their inter se seniority be appointed by the governor under rule 5 b  read with rule 6 and would be placed below the direct recruits. similar exercise for each year in which the substantive vacancies had arisen should be done. the officers he they direct recruits or promotees would rank below the juniormost officer in the list of the previous year. after this exercise is exhausted  appointments should be made  posts are to be filled up to substantive vacancies. these directions would meet the exigencies.

[Facts] one lakshminarayana iyer  a hindu brahmin  who owned considerable properties in the tirunelveli district  died on 13th december  1924  leaving him surviving a widow ranganayaki  and a married daughter ramalakshmi. ramalakshmi had married the plaintiff and had a number of children from him. they were all alive in december  1924  when lakshminarayana died. by this will he gave the following directions     after my lifetime  you  the aforesaid ranganayaki amminal  my wife  shall till your lifetime  enjoy the aforesaid entire properties  the outstandings due to me  the debts payable by me  and the chit amounts payable by me. after your lifetime ramalakshmi ammal  our daughter and wife of rama ayyar avergal of melagaram village  and her heirs shall enjoy them with absolute rights and powers of alienation such as gift  exchange  and sale from son to grandson and so on for generations. as regards the payment of maintenance to be made to chinnanmal alias lakshmi ammal  wife of my late son hariharamayyan  my wife ranganayaki ammal shall pay the same as she pleases  and obtain a release deed. ranganayaki entered into possession of the properties on the death of her husband. on 21st february  1928  she settled the maintenance claim of lakshmi ammal and obtained a deed of release from her by paying her a sum of rs. 3 350 in cash and by executing in her favour an agreement stipulating to pay her a sum of rs. 240 per annum. ramalakshmi died on 25th april  1938 during the lifetime of the widow. none of her children survived her. on the 24th july  1945  the widow describing herself as an absolute owner of the properties of her husband sold one of the items of the property to the 2nd defendant for rs  500. on the 18th september  1945  the suit out of which this appeal arises was instituted by the plaintiff  the husband and the sole heir of ramalakshmi  for a declaration that the said sale would not be binding on him beyond the lifetime of the widow. a prayer was made that the widow be restrained from alienating the other properties in her possession. on the 19th september  1945  an ad interim injunction was issued by the high court restraining the widow from alienating the properties in her possession and forming part of her husband s estate  inspite of this injunction  on the 27th september  1945  she executed two deeds of settlement in favour of the other defendants comprising a number of properties. the plaintiff was allowed to amend his plaint and include therein a prayer for a declaration in respect of the invalidity of these alienations as well. it was averred in the plaint that ramalakshmi obtained a vested interest in the suit  properties under the will of her father and plaintiff was thus entitled to maintain the suit. the defendants pleaded that the plaintiff had no title to maintain the suit  that the widow was entitled under the will to an absolute estate or at least to an estate analogous to and not less than a widow s estate  that the estate given to ramalakshmi under the will was but a contingent one and she having predeceased the widow  no interest in the suit properties devolved on the plaintiff. the main issue in the suit was whether  the widow took under the will an absolute estate or an estate like the hindu widow s estate and whether the daughter s interest therein was in the nature of a contingent remainder  or whether she got in the properties a vested interest. the question as to the validity of the alienations was left undetermined. the unsuccessful defendants preferred an appeal against this decree to the high court of judicature at madras. during the pendency of the appeal the widow died on 14th february  1948. the high court by its judgment under appeal affirmed the decision of the trial judge and maintained his view on the construction of the will. leave to appeal to the supreme court was granted and the appeal was admitted on the 27th november  1951.
[Ratio of the decision] before his death he executed a will on 16th november  1924  the construction of which is in controversy in this appeal. the substantial question to decide in the appeal is whether the estate granted by the testator to his widow was a fall woman s estate under hindu law or merely a limited life estate in the english sense of that expression. it was not contested before us that a hindu can by will create a life estate  or successive life estates  or any other estate for a limited term  provided the donee or the persons taking under it are capable of taking under a deed or will. the decision of the appeal thus turns upon the question whether the testator s intention was to give to his widow ail ordinary life  estate or an estate analogous to that of a hindu widow. at one time it was a moot point whether a hindu widow s estate could be created by will  it being an estate created by law  but it is now settled that a hindu can confer by means of a will oil his widow the same estate which she would get by inheritance. the widow in such a case takes as a demise and not as an heir. the court s primary duty in such cases is to ascertain from the language employed by the testator  what were his intentions   keeping in view the surrounding circumstances  his ordinary notions as a hindu in respect to devolution of his property  his family relationships etc. in other words  to ascertain his wishes by putting itself  so to say  in his armchair. considering the will in the light of these principles it seems to us that lakshminarayan iyer intended by his will to direct that his entire properties should be enjoyed by his widow during her lifetime but her interest in these properties should come to an end on her death  that all these properties in their entirety should thereafter be enjoyed as absolute owners by his daughter and her heirs with powers of alienation  gift  exchange and sale from generation to generation. he wished to make his daughter a fresh stock of descent so that her issue  male or female  may have the benefit of his property. they were the real persons whom he earmarked with certainty as the ultimate recipients of his bounty. in express terms he conferred on his daughter powers of alienation byway of gift  exchange  sale  but in sharp contrast to this  on his widow he conferred no such powers. the direction to her was that she should enjoy the entire properties including the outstandings etc. and these shall thereafter pass to her daughters. though no restraint in express terms was put on her powers of alienation in case of necessity  even that limited power was not given to her in express terms. if the testator had before his mind s eye his daughter and her heirs as the ultimate beneficiaries of his bounty  that intention could only be achieved by giving to the widow a limited estate  because by conferring a full hindu widow s estate on her the daughter will  only have a mere spes successions under the hindu law which may or may not mature and under the will her interest would only be a contingent one in what was left indisposed of by the widow. it is significant that the testator did not say in the will that the daughter will enjoy only the properties left indisposed of by the widow. the extent of the grant  so far as the properties mentioned in the schedule are concerned  to the daughter and the widow is the same. just as the widow was directed to enjoy tile entire properties mentioned in the schedule during her lifetime in like manner the daughter and her heirs were also directed to enjoy the same properties with absolute rights from generation to generation. they could not enjoy the same properties in the manner directed if the widow had a full hindu widow s estate and had the power for any purpose to dispose of them and did so. if that was the intention  the testator would clearly have said that the daughter would only take the properties remaining after the death of the widow. the widow cannot be held to have been given a full hindu widow s estate under the will unless it can be said that under its terms she was given the power of alienation for necessary purposes  whether in express terms or by necessary implication. as above pointed out  admittedly power of alienation in express terms was not conferred on her. the properties disposed of by the will and mentioned in the schedule were considerable in extent and it seems that they fetched sufficient income to enable the widow to fulfil the obligations under the will. indeed we find that within four years of the death of the testator the widow was able to pay a lump sum of rs. 3 350 in cash to the daughter in law without alienating any part of the immovable properties and presumably by this time she had discharged all the debts. it is not shown that she alienated a single item of immovable property till the year 1945  a period of over 21 years after the death of her husband  excepting one  which she alienated in the year 1937 to raise a sum of rs. 1 000 in order to buy some land. by this transaction she substituted one property by another. for the purpose of her maintenance  for payment of debts etc   and for settling the claim of the daughter in law she does not appear to have felt any necessity to make any alienation of any part of the estate mentioned in the schedule and the testator in all likelihood knew that she could fulfil these obligations without having recourse to alienations and hence he did not give her any power to do so. in this situation the inference that the testator must have of necessity intended to confer on the widow power of alienation for those limited purposes cannot be raised. in our opinion  even if that suggestion is accepted that for the limited purposes mentioned in the will the widow could alienate  this power would fall far short of the powers that a hindu widow enjoys under hindu law. under that law she has the power to alienate the estate for the benefit of the soul of the husband  for pilgrimage and for the benefit of the estate and for other authorized purposes. it cannot be said that a hindu widow can only alienate her husband s estate for payment of debts  to meet maintenance charges and for her own maintenance. she represents the estate in all respects and enjoys very wide power except that she cannot alienate except for necessity and her necessities have to be judged on a variety of considerations. she had complete control over the income of the property during her lifetime. but she had no power to deal with the corpus of the estate. and it had to be kept intact for the enjoyment of the daughter. though the daughter was not entitled to immediate possession of the property it was indicated with certainty that she should get the entire estate at the proper time. and she thus got an interest in it on the testator s death. she was given a present right of future enjoyment in the property. according to jarman  jarman on wills   the law leans in favour of vesting of estates and the property disposed of belongs to the object of the gift when the will takes effect and we think the daughter got under this will a vested interest in the testator s properties on his death. this rule of construction by analogy is a dangerous one to follow in construing wills differently worded and executed in different surroundings. vide sasiman v  shib narain 491. a  2 5. however  out of respect for learned counsel on both sides who adopted the same method of approach we proceed to examine some of the important cases referred to by them. the provisions contained in this will bear no analogy to those we have to construe. the restraint against alienation was repugnant to both a life estate and a widow     estate and was not  therefore  taken into account. but there were other indications in that will showing that a widow s estate had been given. the fact that the gift over was a contingent bequest was by itself taken as a sure indication that the preceding bequest was that of a widow s estate. there is no such indication in the will before us. this decision therefore goes against the contention of the learned counsel but he placed reliance on the observations made in the judgment when the learned judge proceeded to say   in deference to the view taken in maharaja of kolhapur v  sundaram iyer  1925  i l r  48 mad. 1  it may be possible to create an interest analogous to a woman s estate in hindu law notwithstanding the addition of a gift over and that the estate taken by s  need not necessarily be only a life estate in the english law sense of the term. we do not understand how such passing observations can be helpful in deciding the present case. assuming that it is possible to create a hindu woman s estate not with standing the addition of a gift over  the question nevertheless whether that had been done in a given case must depend on the terms of the particular instrument under consideration. such casual observation made in respect of a will couched in entirely different terms cannot afford much assistance in the decision of the case. this line of reasoning which appealed to the learned judges is not of much he    to us here as the language hi this will is quite different. if the same line of reasoning is adopted here  the decision of the case would go against the client of mr  k  s  k  iyengar because in the will in this case the widow s estate is delimited by the words  till your lifetime. these remarks do not throw much light on the point before us. these observations are unexceptionable but it may also be pointed out that it is open to a hindu to confer a limited life estate on his widow or even a larger estate than a widow takes as an heir and that in every case he may not confer upon her by will a hindu widow s estate which she would otherwise get by inheritance. generally speaking  there will be no point in making a will if what is to be given to a widow is what she would get on intestacy and cases do arise where a hindu wishes to give to his widow a more restricted estate than she would get on intestacy or a much larger estate than that. the question in every case cannot be determined merely on the theory that every hindu thinks only about a hindu widow s estate and no more. what is given must be gathered from the language of the will in the light of the surrounding circumstances. this decision only decides that case and is not very relevant in this enquiry. these observations have to a certain extent relevance to the present case but on the facts this case is also distinguishable. this will was couched in different language than the will in the present case. there was a clear prohibition  forbidding the widow to make any transfers of the milkiuit estates and the slaves. both the learned counsel eventually conceded that the language used in the will was consistent with the testator s intention of conferring a life estate in the english sense as well as with the intention of conferring a hindu widow s estate.

[Facts] this appeal is by special leave against the judgment and decree of the high court of kerala which dismissed an appeal against the judgment and decree of the subordinate court of havelikkara. the appellant had filed a suit on october 24  1942  for the recovery of rs. 2 lakhs and interest thereon from the date of suit and for costs originally against the state of travancore now the state of kerala the respondent and three others who however were not made parties in the appeal before the high court. it has alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff  appellant  was wrongfully dispossessed from 160 acres of land along with the improvements which had been effected by him and as the state had appropriated those improvements without any right or title thereto he claimed the value of those improvements. it was the appellant s case that he had been in occupation of the said 160 acres of cherikkal land  unregistered dry lands in hilly tracts  about which and the adjoining lands there was a dispute as to whether the same belonged to a jenmi family known as koodalvalli illom  hereinafter called  the illom or to the government of the erstwhile travancore state. the appellant s father and the appellant had occupied these lands  made improvement thereon by planting coconut trees  arecanut palms  peppervines  rubber trees  jack trees  other trees  and by constructing bungalow  huts  wells etc. in the bona fide belief that the lands belonged to the illom. it was stated that according to the practice prevailing in the erstwhile state of travancore the cultivators could enter into unoccupied waste lands belonging to the janmies with the object of cultivating and improving them  and as they held the lands under them by paying rent  the consent of the jemies to such occupation was implied. it may be mentioned that in respect of the 160 acres of land of  the illom which were occupied by the appellant s father and the appellant  there was a dispute between the illom and the travancore state from about 1848. while this dispute was pending it appears the appellant applied to the conservator of forests for registration of the lands in his name  but the application was rejected on june 14  1919 stating that the land applied for cannot be registered  ext  a. while the application for registration was pending  the dispute between the illom and the state of travancore had reached a stage when the illom had to institute a suit o  s  no. 126 of 1096. january 1918  in the district court at quilon for a declaration of its title to those properties. in that suit the appellant  after his application for registration was rejected  sought to get himself impleaded  but that application also was rejected. thereafter the suit filed by the illom was dismissed on 28 6 1109  february 10  1934. an appeal against it was dismissed on september 27  1943. it may here be mentioned that while the suit of the illom i e  o s  no  126 of 1096 m e  was pending in the district court  quilon  the government of travancore had initiated proceedings in ejectment against the appellant by l  c  case. 112 of 1100   1925 a d. as the suit of the illom had been finally disposed of and the title of  the illom to the lands was not established  the appellant apprehending that he might be ejected in the above l c  case filed a suit. o s  156 of 1103 m e   1927 28 a d   in the district court at quilon against the respondent to establish his right and title to the said 160 acres and in the adjoining cherikkal lands in his possession. in that suit an injunction was prayed for in respect of 100 acres of the property involved in the suit  but the prayer was rejected. against that order a civil miscellaneous appeal no  206 of 1110 m e   1934 35 a d   was filed in the high court of travancore. the high court issued a commission for inspecting the properties and the commissioner in his report part 13 of ext. cc set out the improvements made by the appellant on the lands which comprised of a bungalow in which the appellant was residing  a number of small houses. a rubbers state  and a large number of other valuable trees like jack trees  mango trees  coconut trees etc. it appears that as there was no injunction restraining his dispossession in l c  case. 112 of 11  00 m e  an order was passed for dispossessing the appellant on july 24. 1939  ext. vi. the appellant  pursuant to this order  was dispossessed from the lands and possession of these lands was given to the second defendant nair service society ltd  in august 1939. thereafter the suit out of which this appeal arises was filed against the government on october 24  1942. the rest of the claim was dismissed. the high court accepted the finding of the trial court on issue. the contention of the appellant that the trees which are the subject matter of the appeal should have been forfeited by an order passed under s  9 of the act and in the absence of such. an order his right to the value of those trees had to be adjudged and paid. to him was also negatived  as the court held that the words  any crop or other product raised on the land  occurring in s  9 of the act would not include trees. in its view these words take in what is familiarly known in law as  emblements  which according to black s. law dictionary mean  such products of the soil as are annually planted  served and saved by manual labour  as cereals  vegetables  grass maturing for harvest or harvested  etc   but not grass on lands used for pasturage. in this view it held that compensation for trees which are to be dealt with under the general law cannot be decreed in favour of a mere trespasser who had no rights therein. it was also of the view that the claim for compensation for trees which has to be dealt with under the general law under which a mere trespasser would have no rights to the payment of compensation nor could be. appellant be allowed to remove them after his dispossession. another reason for disallowing the compensation for trees given by the high court was that the position of a trespasser whether he be a mere trespasser or a trespasser under a bona fide claim of title  cannot be better than that of a tenant  and that if this is correct  then the appeal has to be dismissed on the short ground that there is no principle of law or equity which requires the payment of compensation in respect of trees  the ownership of which was all along  or at any rate from the dale of the trespasser s dispossession  vested in the state.
[Ratio of the decision] it is the case of the appellant that even  after the act was passed  unauthorised occupants of land belonging to the government who had made improvements therein had  under the rules made both under the act and the land assignment act a preferential claim over others for getting kuthakapattom or assignment of the property in their possession. there were other allegations also but it is unnecessary for purposes of this appeal to refer to them. several issues were framed  but it is not necessary to refer to  them except to say that the suit was decreed only for rs. 3000 being the value of the appellant s bungalow taken possession of by the respondent. it may be stated that the finding that the possession of the appellant  commenced after his application for registration was rejected in 1919  and the improvements  if any must have been effected only thereafter with full knowledge that the title to the lands was in dispute between the illom and the government  is unassailable. we have earlier adverted to ext. a and also to the fact that after the application for registration was  rejected the appellant tried to get himself impleaded in the suit filed by the illom against the state which application was also rejected and so the claim that his possession was bona fide or that he was a bona fide  trespasser. has no validity. this finding is fortified by s  5 of the act which provides that from and after the commencement of the act it shall not be lawful for any person to occupy land which is the property of the government whether poramboke or not without the permission from the government or such officer of the government as may be  empowered in that behalf. in view of this specific provision the contravention of which is punishable under s  6 thereof  his conduct in applying for registration and for getting himself impleaded in the suit of the illom against the government  would show that he knew that the land was government land or land in which the government had a claim. in these circumstances he cannot be said to be a bona fide trespasser particularly after he had applied to the government for obtaining  a. registration in his name on the basis that it was government land. this section provides for two notices to be given one notice is to be given to the person who is in unauthorised occupation of government land to vacate the land within a reasonable time and the other notice is to forfeit any crop or other product raised on the land or to remove any building or other structure erected or anything deposited therein within a reasonable time as may be stated in the notice. it was conceded before the trial court and no attempt was made to establish anything to the contrary before the high court that no notice of forfeiture as required under s  9 was given to the appellant. in these circumstances  the question that would arise for determination is whether the trees come within the description of  other product raised on the land. it is stated before us that at the time when the appellant was evicted the transfer of property act was not in force. but this is not relevant as what has to be considered is whether trees can be said to be  other product raised on the land. the words  raised on the land  qualify both the  crop  and  other product   so the words  other product  have to be read in the context of the word  crop  which precedes it. even under this definition  product  cannot mean anything which is attached to the land like trees. it may  however  include the fruit of the trees. we have already agreed with the trial court and the high court that the appellant was not a bona fide trespasser. according to his submission a person is nevertheless a bona fide trespasser if he enters upon the land with a bona fide intention of improving the land. no authority has been cited for this novel proposition  and if accepted  it would give validity to a dangerous principle which will condone all acts of deliberate and wrongful trespass because any person desparate enough to trespass on other mans  land without any claim of title can always plead that he had a bona fide intention of improving the land whether the owner of that land wants that improvement or not. this vicarious and altruistic exhibition of good intention may even cause damage to the land of an owner who may not want improvements of such a kind as tree plantation. it is true that the maxim of the english law  quicquid plantatur solo  solo cedit  i e  whatever is affixed to the soil belongs to the soil  is. not applicable in india but that is not to say that a wrongful trespasser can plant trees on someone else s land and claim a right to those trees after he is evicted. this case does not support the contention that a mere trespasser who has deliberately and wrongfully contrary to the provisions of s  5 of the act  entered  upon another s land which makes such an act even punishable under s  6 thereof  is entitled to compensation for the trees planted by him on the land. in any case  as the high court rightly observed  the position of a trespasser cannot be better than that of a lawful tenant who having lost his possession cannot claim compensation or damages for anything erected on the land or any improvements made therein. the appellant s claim after he was evicted cannot  on the same parity of reasoning  be held to be valid. once the appellant s counsel was confronted i with this proposition  he tried to raise an entirely new point  namely  that no notice of eviction was given to the appellant  and if such a notice had been given to him under s  9  he would have cut the trees and taken them away  within the time allowed for him to vacate the lands. in support of this contention he has referred us to the leadings contained in paragraph 3 of the plaint in which it is stated    the improvements effected by the plaintiff have a value of rs  2 lakhs as per the accounts shown below. in his helplessness the plaintiff had even applied to government to give him the land in which he had effected improvements  on kuthakapattom. but out of the said land 160 acres were taken out of my possession and given to the 2nd defendant even without giving me the opportunity to remove the movable improvements  such as cultivation  cattle  machines  utensils  houses  stocked crops  ripe crops etc   belonging to me. these averments in the above paragraph do not clearly allege that he was not evicted without notice  nor has any allegation been made that he was forcibly evicted from the lands with the help of the police etc  as it has now been contended before us. on the other hand what the plaintiff  appellant  stated shows that no opportunity was given to him to remove the movable improvements  such as cultivation  cattle  machines  utensils  houses  stocked crops  ripe crops etc  which belonged to him. there is nothing stated by him that he had no opportunity to cut trees and take them away. even in paragraph 4 of the plaint where he complains that no notice of forfeiture was given to him  he mentions only the items referred to in paragraph 3. it is in this connection  he says  that no legal procedure had been followed by government for taking them into possession  which only implies that it is in respect of the items mentioned in paragraph 3. it is again stated in  paragraph 4 that  it was irregular on the part of government to take possession of the above items. the respondent did not understand the averments in the plaint as alleging that no notice to quit was given to him is evident from the written statement of the respondent in paragraph  where it is stated thus. this defendant submits that after due notice an order of forfeiture has been passed in poramboke case 112 of 11 00 and the plaintiff is therefore not entitled to claim any value of improvements or value of any building. the issues that had been famed by the trial court also do not refer to this aspect. no doubt in the evidence of the plaintiff p w  1 states that he was evicted from the lands without giving him an opportunity to remove the improvements  and in cross examination he was asked whether he was not given any notice prior to the dispossession and he said that certainly no notice was  received. p w  4 the manager was asked in cross examination whether he had been given any priorinformation or notice about eviction and this witness also said that there was no prior information or notice. while these passages might show that no notice of eviction was given  even at that stage there was no application for an issue being framed  nor has such an application been made in the appeal before the high court  nor even before this court. in it has been held that the appellant was not a mere trespasser and had deliberately entered upon the lands knowing full well that he had no right  claim or title to the lands or had in any manner a right to enter the land and has been rightly evicted as a trespasser  he cannot now be permitted to raise this contention before us.

[Facts] three civil appeals  stemming from three revision petitions to the high court of orissa under the orissa estates abolition act  1951  orissa act i of 1952   for short  the act  have reached this court  thanks to special leave granted to the appellant  who is common in all the cases. the high court  after deciding various issues  remanded the cases to the compensation officer under the act  after over ruling most of the contentions pressed before it by the appellant. shri achutananda purohit  appellant  was the intermediary in respect of vast forests and other lands comprised in the estate of jujumura in the district of sambalpur. the appellant has received around rs. 3 00 000   but much more  according to him  is due and this controversy can be settled by examining his specific points. shri purohit  appellant  is an advocate by profession and is 83 years old. the compensation officer passed an order adverse to the appellant  where upon he filed an appeal to the collector which was rejected. a second appeal followed before the board of revenue which was dismissed. later  revision petition were filed before the high court and g  k  misra j   set aside the order disallowing the inclusion of the income from forests for ascertainment of compensation and directed a remand to the compensation officer. the said order  the relevant portion of which we are concerned  runs thus    he would immediately call upon the divisional forest officer to make appraisement within three months from the receipt of the record. the appraisement can be scientifically done by looking to the age of the trees as they stand now. it is open to the petitioners to give evidence that after the date of vesting many of the trees and forest produce have been removed. besides the evidence already on record would be taken into consideration. the divisional forest officer who would make the appraisement will be examined as a witness for the compensation officer and would be subjected to cross examination. no other evidence would be permissible as the state has not chosen to give any other evidence. under rule 13 1 c  of the orissa estates abolition rules  1952 the compensation officer may rely upon such other materials as may otherwise be ascertained by him. but in such a case the materials must be brought to the notice of the petitioners who would be entitled to cross examine the witnesses connected therewith and may give rebutting evidence. the compensation case is to be disposed of by the compensation officer within six months from today  104 1969  with intimation to this court. the district forest officer  who  incidentally  happens to be a forest officer under the act  having been appointed as required thereunder  made his appraisal of the annual income and submitted to the chief conservator who altered the annual yield and reduced it substantially. but he pointed out that the forest officer had omitted to include the income from kendu leaves and added that sum to the income from forests. even so  the total figure was less than what the divisional forest officer had recommended. the compensation officer accepted the report of the chief conservator and made the statutory calculation on that date. both the state and the appellant filed appeals to the collector which were dismissed. a second appeal was filed by the appellant before the board of revenue without success. then followed three revision petitions to the high court which led to the order of remand now attacked before us in the present appeals. from this narrative  what follows is that the chief conservator had substituted his appraisement which was accepted by the statutory tribunal.
[Ratio of the decision] this estate vested in the state on april 1  1960 by force of the act and the crucial question agitated before us  consequentially turns on the quantum of compensation awardable under chapter v of the act. he has argued in person and with passion. we have listened with patience to all his submissions  good  bad and indifferent. if we may anticipate ourselves  none of the nine submissions has appealed to us  save to the extent the high court has upheld. even so  a minimal narration of the facts and a brief consideration of each argument is necessary and we proceed to do so. while his arguments did not impress us  we were touched by his concluding words that he had been born and had grown in an adivasi village  in the only brahmin family and  in his evening years of life  proposed to give a substantial part of the compensation the state would give him for adivasi welfare. although he waxed sentimentally on this note  he did not convince us on his contentions. with these prefatory observations  we proceed to formulate the many points urged and give our findings and reasons  one after the other. we are directly concerned with the issue of compensation which is dealt with  as earlier stated  in chapter v of the act. the compensation officer is charged with fixing the quantum in the prescribed manner. a compensation assessment roll containing the gross asset and net income of each estate  together with the compensation payable in respect of such estate  has to be prepared by him. against the background of law just projected  we may set out shri purohit s points which  if we may say so  are substantially the same as have been argued by him in revision before the high court with partial success. for convenience of reference  we may extract the statement by the high court of the contentions urged before it  and repeated before us  by the appellant. the meat of the matter  the primary question agitated in the appeal  lopping off the fringe issues of lesser import  consists in the statutory methodology and functionaries prescribed by the act for quantifying the compensation and the compliance therewith by the statutory machinery in the case of the appellant. but before examining this essential issue we may dispose of the minor points pressed  so that the deck may be cleared for dealing with what deserves to be dealt with. point no  9  in the catalogue already given  relates to the claim for 12  interest on the amount of compensation as against the statutory rate of 2 1 2. a similar principle applies to the award of interest which may sometimes be notional when feudal interests are puffed out. we cannot import the notion of prevailing bank rates in such situations. the dynamic rule of law  with a social mission  makes a meaningful distinction between rights steeped in the old system and compensation for deprivation of those interests  on the one hand  and the ordinary commercial transactions or regulation of rights untinged by social transformation urges  on the other. this gives rationality to the seeming disparity. holmes once commented   it is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that. so it was laid down in the time of henry iv. here there is good reason to depart from the old rule of full compensation and it perhaps legitimates the reduced rate of recompense. moreover  the high court has rightly pointed out that the validity of s  37 3  of the act which fixes a small rate of interest on the compensation amount has been upheld by the supreme court in gajapati narayan s case. point no  8 has only to be stated to be rejected. the contention is that on the date of vesting  which was well over two decades ago  the purchasing power of the rupee was much higher than its present value. it is more or less a world phenomenon that the erosi on in value of the unit of currency has been taking place  but this invisible devaluation owing to the inflationary spiral does not affect the quantum of monetary compensation prescribed by statute. for the purposes of the law  the rupee of long ago is the same as the rupee of today  although for the purposes of the market place and cost of living  the housewife s answer may be different. law is sometimes blind. the next point in the reverse order is equally unsubstantial and may be disposed of right away. the appellant challenges the slab system of compensation provided in the act which awards smaller multiples for estates yielding larger incomes  on the score of violation of the fundamental rights under the constitution. the short answer is that art. 31 3  read with art. 31 2  bars any challenge to the amount of compensation on acquisition by the state subject to compliance with the prescriptions in the said sub articles  on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate. presidential assent has been accorded to this state act and so the ban operates. moreover  art. 31a repels the applicability of arts. 14  19 and 31 to the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein etc. this provision directly demolishes the contention of the appellant. point no  6 in the list of contentions earlier reproduced is also bereft of force and we may make short shrift of it. here again  the flaw in the submission consists in mis reading s  27 of the act which expressly states that the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting from the gross assets of such estate any sum  which was payable by the intermediary as income tax in respect of any income derived from such estate for the previous agricultural year. no income  therefore no income tax  and therefore no deduction  is the syllogism of shri purohit. he forgets that in the case of forests it is the assumed income and not the actual income that forms the basis of calculation of compensation. indeed  if the actual income were to be the foundation for computation of compensation on the premise that not actual income has accrued  the compensation might be zero. on the other hand  statutory compensation is provided for on the formula of assumed income in the previous year. similarly  an assumed income  tax also has to be worked out and deducted. if a notional income on the assumed basis can be used for fixing compensation  a notional income tax can be calculated and deducted. the confusion that vitiates the argument is prompted by a circular letter of government regarding non deductibility of income tax due to the state from the amount of compensation lying to the credit of estate holders. we have examined the circular letter and are satisfied that it has no relevance to a situation like the present and it deals with a totally different matter. in short  s  27 properly construed  cannot lend itself to the meaning imputed to it by the appellant. the serious question that survives for consideration is covered by the remaining points which more or less overlap. the statutory scheme of compensation for forest lands consists of machinery for assessment of the net income which is multiplied on a sliding scale and the method of challenge to the determination by the aggrieved owner of state. so the first step is for the government to appoint forest officers from out of d f os. in the forest department  for the purposes of the act. those officers ascertain the income from the forest concerned and the figure so fixed is subject to the approval of the c c f   chief conservator of forests   presumably the top expert in the department. the power to approve implies the power to disapprove or modify but not to report or arrive at an income de hors the forest officer s report altogether. the section is clear that the gross income from forests must be calculated on the basis of appraisal of the annual yield on the date of vesting firstly  by a forest officer and  secondly  by the chief conservator of forests screening it and approving it. indeed  preliminary to the appraisal operation  the intermediary receives a notice in form  d   rule 13  and he is expected to furnish a return of the relevant particulars and supporting information to enable correct appraisement. in the present case  the appellant did submit the  d  return to the compensation officer and adduced some evidence to substantiate it. strictly speaking  the statutory requirement is for initial appraisal of the annual income by the forest officer. the use of the expression  divisional forest officers is erroneous although forest officers are appointed from among divisional forest officers. equally clearly  a slight error has crept into the judge s order because he does not make any reference specifically to the statutory requirement of approval of the chief conservator of forests of the appraisement made by the forest officer. however  what followed is interesting though erroneous. indeed  there was a fundamental difference in the basis adopted by the forest officer and the chief conservator in the matter of assessing the income of the forests in question. we need not go into this detail except for the purpose of noticing that what the chief conservator did was not to approve wholly or in a modified form what the forest officer did but to make his own appraisal independently and without reference to the report of the statutory functionary  viz   the forest officer. this was wrong and contrary to s  26  as was contended by the appellant and in a way accepted by the high court. having heard the appellant at some length  we see no flaw in the high court s order on this aspect of the matter. it is astonishing that anyone should urge  as the appellant did  that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have been made and since that had not been done  the compensation officer had become functus officio in awarding compensation. before the date of vesting the state never can  nor does  fix the compensation through the compensation officer in any of the agrarian reform laws  and these compensation operations are post statutory exercises. therefore there is no substance in the functus officio argument. if the officer had no jurisdiction  the land would be gone because of the vesting provision and no compensation would be forthcoming for want of jurisdiction a consequence the appellant never wants. technicality can be frightened away by technicality. nor is it right to contend  as the appellant did  that the compensation officer s jurisdiction was created by the order of remand by the high court. no  it was created by the statute and canalised by the order of remand. it follows that  after the present second remand  the re appraisal of the annual net income cannot be done solely by the forest officer without securing the approval of the chief conservator. nor can the compensation officer by pass the chief conservator on the misunderstood strength of the high court s first order of remand. the true legal drill is. and this holds good after the second remand order that the forest officer will do the appraisement of the annual income  forward his report to the chief conservator of forests who will take the said report into consideration and  if necessary  make modifications therein or approve it with such changes as he deems fit. certainly the chief conservator cannot be ignored by the compensation officer nor can the chief conservator ignore the assessment made by the forest officer and go through an independent exercise. the integrated process has already been explained by us and will be followed in the proceedings to ensue on remand. we may make it clear that now that a forest officer has made an appraisement  the chief conservator of forests will apply his mind to it and approve it as a whole or with such modifications as he thinks necessary and forward it to the compensation officer. this will  among other things  save time. thereafter  the appropriate statutory course will follow. substantially  this is what has been done by the learned judge when allowing the revisions and remitting the case back to the compensation officer. the take over of the forests of the appellant was effected as early as 1960 and 16 years have passed without the intermediary being out of the litigative woods. the high court has stated that a large part of the delay has been  due to laches committed from time to time by the officers who have been charged with the duty to calculate the compensation. it is again due to mistakes committed by the authorities concerned that the matter is being remitted back to the compensation officer for disposal. in this context  it is perhaps not irrelevant to remember that the appellant  a freedom fighter  is an 83 year old man and  at this stage of his life  the state should show commisseration not merely in quickly disposing of the proceedings but also in not being cantankerous in awarding and disbursing the balance compensation.
